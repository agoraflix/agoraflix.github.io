1
00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.340
Donald Trump has decided that he doesn't like Iran

2
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.340
He doesn't really care about the words of experts of IAEA

3
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.340
He's not really interested in the opinion of countries that made their best to solve all the diplomatic issues

4
00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.740
The main task is to change all the things, which were made by Obama

5
00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.700
He started to threaten Iran directly

6
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.700
As a result we have another extremely unpleasant tension in the Middle East

7
00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.620
This night Israel attacked military bases of Iran located in Syria

8
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.660
They explained such harsh measures with an attack of Israeli forces located near Holland Heights.

9
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.140
According to our Ministry of Defense, more than a half of the missiles were intercepted with the air defense systems.

10
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.180
Both Israel and Iran don't really want to create more tension in this situation

11
00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.940
However, any unwanted and unpleasant action can cause a massive war even today

12
00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.940
Because when they take a fundamental agreement

13
00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.180
about Iran, and remove its foundation, destroying all the progress

14
00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.220
They destroy everything at once. That means we can wait for more tension in Syria

15
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.820
I can even predict that the USA will drop bombs on the territory of Iran

16
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.820
They will use the same logic. They will tell: "We think that nuclear centers are located here, here and there."

17
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.460
They also may use depth bombs. We have seen one of them in Afghanistan.

18
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.740
They will say: "Look! We are liberating the people of Iran."

19
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.220
From the air! From the air!

20
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.460
As usual. Who's going to be extremely happy? Saudi Arabia

21
00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.180
they will support all their action

22
00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.180
Of course, Israel will support the USA because Iran wants to eliminate such country as Israel

23
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.700
and the UAE. The thing is that Trump requires something, which can't be completed or achieved by any country.

24
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.380
So they are trying to say: "Oh, Iran, you have to stop breathing."

25
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.180
Because their requirements are simply impossible to be met! Please tell me what's going on there!

26
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.140
You have no idea about Trump. He's a businessman, he's a developer

27
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.700
He's a person, who earns a lot of money

28
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.700
He knows how to talk with politicians, even though he may have a lack of experience in direct communication with the most important politicians from all over the world.

29
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.020
In fact this problem is not about defense or the national security policies

30
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.420
This is a financial question. The thing is that the entire situation creates threat for the financial system of the USA.

31
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.500
And it affects the financial system in both ways: the monetary policy and revenue security

32
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.820
Trump continued to follow all stages of the settlement plan

33
00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.020
until the moment when people came to him

34
00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:56.020
those were financial experts, who told him: "Look, it's time to get our money back!"

35
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:01.820
Nobody knows the amount of Iran's money blocked in the USA

36
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.900
there are many versions, but let's say there are 150 billion USD

37
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.580
150 billion USD

38
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.380
We passed the first stages of the agreement, and the time has come

39
00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.540
Now it's time to bring the money back

40
00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.100
Trump is a businessman, so he asked: "What are we going to get in return?"

41
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.020
These amounts of money are frozen in the USA since the late 70's, and all of them are invested in local bonds

42
00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.940
and the national treasuries

43
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.540
What's going to happen if we return them to their legal owners, and they will sell them?

44
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.500
The Minister of finances predicts an immediate default

45
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.660
We can't bear it because selling 150 billion USD at once will kill the exchange

46
00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.700
Trump asks about the consequences for the dollar, and gets the very same answer

47
00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.260
Iran will introduce a law, making EURO the unique currency, which can be used there

48
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.460
There are many other currencies, but they will use EURO.

49
00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.740
Have you noticed that Trump is trying to be polite? He managed to shift the final date more than several times.

50
00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.860
He gave enough time for Iran to think

51
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.860
He offered them to find a mutually beneficial solution. He asked Iran not to withdraw the money, but they told him that there's no such person, who can make such a decision.

52
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.180
Both the president and the spiritual leader can't make such decision

53
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.180
The main problem is money. All other things are made to make the entire situation look better.

54
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.500
All wars happen because of money

55
00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.500
Yes, all the wars start because of money

56
00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.420
We need to remember the last days of De Gaulle regime.

57
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.420
He sent two ships of dollars, asking to change them to real gold

58
00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:25.540
Later he faced student protests, and had to leave his office

59
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:27.500
Yes, yes... let's move on

60
00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.500
Americans don't really want to go deeper, bombing Iran and spending a lot of time in the region

61
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.940
They need to leave Middle East

62
00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.620
They have a new strategic threat, and they don't have enough money to cover all the problems

63
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.540
These days the key strategic threat for the USA is China

64
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.180
After solving the problem of the South China Sea

65
00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.180
when Chinese submarines have successfully entered the Pacific Ocean

66
00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.580
They can attack the USA anytime

67
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.980
But who has money?

68
00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.580
Both Pentagon and the Ministry of Defense do

69
00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.580
Saudis have money! And they will pay the fortune to destroy their key strategic enemy!

70
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:12.900
Saudis are rich, but they are not as rich, as you, Vladimir Rudolfovoich (the host), think

71
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.900
They have a deep crisis, and they don't have money now!

72
00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.900
I can even see their tears (Saudis)

73
00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.900
They cry every single day because they have no money

74
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.900
And they enter new and new agreements to buy and sell weapons

75
00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.340
I came from Tehran just one day before yesterday!

76
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.980
I came a couple of days ago after spending 20 days there

77
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.420
You are lucky enough to return before the bombing

78
00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.420
I think that this version is viable, but

79
00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:38.300
this is not the key problem, and the problem is different

80
00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.300
Even during his presidential campaign Trump said that

81
00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.380
he would break this deal

82
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.340
He called the deal useless and catastrophic

83
00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:53.180
This deal was made by Obama

84
00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.180
And he does that not because he wants to destroy the legacy of Obama! Of course no.

85
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.220
I think this problem is much deeper than we think

86
00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.220
And today we can only compare the information. There are three key points of the conflict.

87
00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.900
Far East and North Korea

88
00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.500
Syria and Iran

89
00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.500
Trump tried to find the ways to make an agreement about Syria

90
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.260
And they are still trying to make something, working in the direct cooperation

91
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.860
on several layers: military, political and diplomatic.

92
00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.460
He managed to work with both North Korea and South Korea

93
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:36.460
He also worked with the main "Master" and protector of North Korea - China

94
00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:42.020
But he always knew how to find a solution. He couldn't find the similar approach for Iran.

95
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:47.020
These days, when we know that the USA will leave JCPOA

96
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.500
Trump creates tension with his NATO allies

97
00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:56.700
and political partners within the EU

98
00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:00.420
He's not interested in anything, and this is his bee in the bonnet

99
00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:04.220
He wants to destroy Iran

100
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:06.260
Why? It's a key for the Middle East

101
00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:11.260
Americans have lost their control in a zone, which has always been considered a strategic one for them

102
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.900
In 2015, Putin took all this in his hands, and started moving forward

103
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:24.900
and Russia finally managed to return to Middle East

104
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.420
using Syria.

105
00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.260
Only now Trump understands that

106
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.980
the key for Middle East is hidden in Iran

107
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.980
His allies shall be Saudi Arabia and Persian monarchies

108
00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.620
not to mention Israel

109
00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:45.620
and I think that he managed to open a new business of the day

110
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:51.620
discussing the future war in the region

111
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.060
Just think, what can happen in this situation?

112
00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:01.060
If Trump, keeping his inability to make consequential actions,

113
00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:07.580
sees that he can't find an agreement with his European partners,

114
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.580
he will face total lack of understanding from China - it's obvious

115
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.180
because China has already expressed its will

116
00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:21.180
He may stop any talks with his allies and partners, switching to the military phase.

117
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:24.420
But he never did this in Korea

118
00:08:24.420 --> 00:08:28.100
Host: it's too early to say that!

119
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:29.580
Korea has nuclear weapons

120
00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:31.660
But Iran doesn't have, and it can't protect itself

121
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.060
They can easily buy it from Pakistan

122
00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:39.060
I think that Iran

123
00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:42.820
will find its own approach to the entire situation, and we can discuss it too

124
00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.900
But everything depends on the position of the USA

125
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:49.140
And they can use the same "method of the flask"

126
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:51.060
with no evidence

127
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.420
confronting everyone

128
00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:58.420
Just look at the actions of the USA in Middle East! They are sending troops every single day!

129
00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.780
Host: Will they attack Iran?

130
00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:00.620
They will

131
00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.420
They will do!
Host: I think the same.

132
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:07.420
The fact that Israel has already checked the position of Iran on Syria

133
00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.500
allows us to predict future attacks

134
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.100
they can even use the most powerful bombs

135
00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:17.420
keeping the provisions of their new nuclear strategy

136
00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:20.180
they can even use nuclear bombs of low power

137
00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.580
He told everything. Trump never hides anything!

138
00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:28.340
He says: "I will show you something, which you've never seen before!"

139
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.860
He said the same things in Korea

140
00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:32.380
Hmmm... He had to use more complex statements in Korea

141
00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.620
Korea has nuclear weapon and Korea has missiles

142
00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:41.620
There's no problem... Iran can easily buy a nuclear bomb from Pakistan

143
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:45.020
Host: They can't!
There's no problem at all

144
00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:48.140
They have a key, which can be used to explode everything!

145
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.540
They won't do that for sure

146
00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:53.780
They are too late...
I wouldn't be so sure that they are late

147
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.740
Did they buy it?
No... and that's the thing!

148
00:09:55.740 --> 00:09:57.820
They would tell me for sure

149
00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:02.820
No we have to think about our 90 billion USD, which are kept in bonds in the USA. Are we going to have the very same scenario?

150
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.540
No, that's simply impossible

151
00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:13.500
You need to listen him! He's a candidate to be a vice-prime minister, and he's says such behavior is going to be financial terrorism.

152
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:15.740
He says it's simply impossible!

153
00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:20.180
Americans can't lie because they have such sincere eyes... But I want to highlight three main points:

154
00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:25.180
All these things remind me the situation in the 70's

155
00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:31.940
They make a set of small attacks and provocations, which destabilize the entire situation.

156
00:10:35.340 --> 00:10:37.860
resulting in a massive conflict.

157
00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:42.860
Keeping in mind the current situation, such massive conflict may be launched virtually any time.

158
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:49.100
It can develop really fast, as a result of wrong actions, misunderstandings and interpretations.

159
00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:55.180
Let's imagine that a missile from an Arabic country will reach an oil refinery in Haifa.

160
00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:59.540
And Israel has to answer such actions, there's no other option.

161
00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.540
The second point is also really important

162
00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.500
Trump is always pushing people to be hurry

163
00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:10.180
I think... he promised to make all these things on 12th

164
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:15.700
He couldn't even wait for that date

165
00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:20.820
He doesn't know what dialog is. Trump can work only in the monologue mode.

166
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.980
Do you understand me? In my opinion the leader of North Korea is the winner in this situation.

167
00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.780
Why? He pressed Trump and insisted on the dialog.

168
00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.300
They had a dialog in the field of power, when each action from one side resulted in a similar action from the other side.

169
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.740
But still, it was a dialog.
What's the point of it?

170
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:39.820
The point is really simple.
No, I'm talking about other things.

171
00:11:39.820 --> 00:11:44.820
By leaving this agreement unilaterally, Trump has shown to the entire world that any agreement with the USA is not worth even the paper, which was used to print it.

172
00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:55.300
Yes!
If a president signs an agreement, and UN Security Council accepts a resolution of the agreement

173
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:03.780
Then the USA elects a new president who says: "What's this? I don't like it, and I want to quit."

174
00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:10.420
Another great thing is the fact that we can see the real price of the US allies

175
00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.500
I'm talking about allies in Europe. They are nothing, and their opinion means nothing too.

176
00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:19.500
Trump is scared of the dialog. I think he was afraid of an offer to find a solution for the entire situation.

177
00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.420
and he decided to act first.

178
00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.540
And he needs a war!
Yes, he needs a war!

179
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:33.420
And the last... I don't want to say that, but he needs a war in any case.

180
00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:38.340
And the last point. There's a giant American group located in the region.

181
00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:43.340
Keeping in mind that they have some secret resources in Qatar, UAE and Saudi Arabia

182
00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.740
I would say that they are ready to start something. Maybe it's not an average conflict, but they can make three waves of aerial attacks. And they have enough resources for that.

183
00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:00.620
And I have real doubts that Iranian air defense system will be able to resist such attacks.

184
00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:06.700
Furthermore, there are high chances that Saudi Arabia can become a sacred victim in this case

185
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:12.180
And we are going to have a totally new situation.
Nobody will use their own wallet as a victim.

186
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:16.060
But they may insist, and ask their wallet (Saudi) to pay for them.
That's another point.

187
00:13:16.060 --> 00:13:20.060
Saudi money is kept out of Saudi Arabia

188
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:25.060
If they decided to betray Saudi Arabia, they need to ask the following question: Who will take money?

189
00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:30.260
Money will be kept in the very same US bonds

190
00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.300
That's why I wouldn't ignore this option.

191
00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:39.300
In addition to all other things, this situation clearly demonstrates us who starts all the wars on the planet.

192
00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.940
They often accuse Russia, saying that we increased tension, we did one thing, we did another thing

193
00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:54.260
And Russia makes the world a terrible place, preparing the ground for World War 3

194
00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:00.860
In fact, all these problems are the result of the US global policies

195
00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:03.980
Their policy is based on conflicts. They can't exist without conflicts

196
00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:05.980
They need conflicts to support and protect their mastery and reign.

197
00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:10.020
In case when there are no conflicts, countries are not scared on the US mastery

198
00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:13.020
countries start to avoid believing you, that's why Americans

199
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:18.020
that's why the USA has to replicate their own behavior in order to rule the world, and show their power

200
00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.820
The USA creates the risk of total elimination of the world and World War 3 by implementing their weird policies

201
00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:34.020
Their European allies became aware of this fact just now. They understood that they are useless, and nobody is going to listen to them.

202
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:39.020
But they are not blind nor deaf. They can see the results created by their American patrons.

203
00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:45.260
The USA destroys their (EU) normal relations with the countries like Russia, while the EU could benefit from such relations

204
00:14:45.340 --> 00:14:48.580
Now let's talk about Iran

205
00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.620
I understand the level of tension in this case

206
00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:57.620
But I don't think there will be any kind of a massive attack towards Iran

207
00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:03.860
Which problems are they going to solve by performing such an attack?

208
00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:06.900
Will they solve the problem of changing the leader in Iran?

209
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:11.780
I'm not sure. Will they eliminate Iran as a key player in the region?

210
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:14.500
I don't think so. Iran won't simply disappear

211
00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:18.820
That's my opinion. Of course, they can do something like that, but

212
00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:23.820
such action will never allow reaching the goals, which the USA had set many years before.

213
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.340
They have the following term - unacceptable losses

214
00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.900
They will give an adequate answer for any attack from the air

215
00:15:30.900 --> 00:15:33.020
Iran will enter Iraq

216
00:15:33.020 --> 00:15:35.260
How?
They will invade Iraq and Syria

217
00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:38.740
Iran will never attack the territory of the USA

218
00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:41.820
They will attack Iraq really easy. They have a lot of bases there. There are many soldiers too

219
00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:46.820
And it's not an occasion that they started all these things now. Do you remember that Iran was full of protests just a while ago.

220
00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:52.540
And those protests weren't light and easy, as it was predicted before.

221
00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:56.660
A couple of important cities were invaded by protesters

222
00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.820
And the reaction of the government was not really good.

223
00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:02.780
The elite of the Iran...

224
00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:05.660
they are divided into many parts

225
00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:10.660
The most important thing is the fact that both conservators and reformers are having almost the same level of popularity.

226
00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:19.540
There's no difference among them now. They are balanced.

227
00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.100
They can change the regime with a single attack.

228
00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:27.980
That's why we see such a harsh reaction of the country leader.

229
00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:32.980
He is aware of the fact that if they don't have nuclear resources to resist the USA, they will face an inevitable catastrophe.

230
00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:39.220
I want to agree with the majority of you

231
00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:44.220
The main thing is the fact that Trump it trying to avoid impeachment prepared by the Democratic Party

232
00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:49.500
That's why he's trying to deal with Korea, and spending his tie to solve the problem of Iran.

233
00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:54.500
We need to understand that Iran is not just a country as a piece of land

234
00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:58.500
Iran is a major player. Iran is in Syria, Iran is in Yemen

235
00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.180
Iran is in Afghanistan

236
00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:04.940
Do you remember his words when he decided to leave this agreement on nuclear weapons?

237
00:17:04.940 --> 00:17:08.540
He said that now we are going to talk about the system of ballistic missiles

238
00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:13.540
and we are going to discuss the influence of Iran in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen.

239
00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:17.900
Let's talk about the attack that took place last night

240
00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:21.140
It happened after the visit of Netanyahu to Moscow

241
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:25.140
Probably he informed them about the reaction to any provocation

242
00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:30.140
Second thing that the attack was made when Hezbollah won parliamentary elections in Lebanon

243
00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:35.660
Now such response for their provocation can be made from Lebanon and from the south of Syria.

244
00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:44.900
In just a couple of days Iraq is going to have parliamentary elections too

245
00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:47.580
There are high chances that the supporters of Iran will win them

246
00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:52.580
So the fact that Iran takes power in all problematic regions

247
00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:00.100
We remember that Israel was able to enter Syria and perform attacks, having zero response from local armies

248
00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:04.700
Last night we saw something new for the first time.

249
00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:09.700
Israel never shares information, and we can talk about 220 or 40 rockets coming from the other side, but we will never know the real number.

250
00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:20.540
and we don't know how they landed. Just a couple of months ago F15 or F16 of Israeli forces was downed in Syria

251
00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:27.940
The region is facing a new balance of powers. Before that time the USA was able to work there having no issues

252
00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:30.820
And now they are facing a lot of issues.

253
00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:35.820
Americans have never been attacked in the east of Syria

254
00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:39.220
It's really easy to make that. They can be attacked in Iraq too

255
00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:42.620
There's a base there too. Iran has a lot of ballistic missiles

256
00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:44.980
Hezbollah has 150 thousand missiles

257
00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:49.900
So try to imagine the number of weapons in Iran!
150 000?!
Yes, they have 150 000 in the south of Lebanon.

258
00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.620
They are low- and mid- range missiles, but they will reach their targets for sure

259
00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:57.820
And we can see that so-called "Metal shield" of Israel

260
00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:00.820
shows that some rockets can't be intercepted

261
00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.620
I think that 150 000 is too much.
No, we are talking about small missiles.

262
00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:06.620
We are talking about so-called 'hurricane' - you need 16 of them for a single shot.

263
00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.620
and it turns out...

264
00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.500
These numbers were published in media, but they are considered exaggerated

265
00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.500
Of course!

266
00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.500
Even if they have 50 000...

267
00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:17.700
I feel myself in the middle of an eastern market (bazaar)

268
00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:20.260
But look.
Well, 50 thousand or 150...

269
00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:25.260
If they decide to attack Iran, there may be an adequate answer because they have a lot of bases in the gulf

270
00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:30.380
They can easily answer... They can do the same in Afghanistan too

271
00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:34.580
But you need to understand that such attacks are not occasional, and they are not blind

272
00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:38.380
They are trying to hit the most important military objects too

273
00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:41.060
They attack headquarters and air defense systems

274
00:19:41.060 --> 00:19:46.060
We have to understand one important thing before talking about the problems between Iran and Israel

275
00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:52.140
Before Iran, the entire Islamic world considered Israel an enemy.

276
00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:55.340
Today Iran and Shias are considered enemies

277
00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:00.340
So the current shape and state of Iran is really useful for Israel

278
00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:08.500
Israel says: "Let Iran stop talking about the elimination of Israel, and we will be fine with them."

279
00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:14.100
It really helps Likud and Netanyahu to create a consolidated position

280
00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.380
You need to understand that people can claim virtually anything

281
00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:20.660
So, is Iran useful for them too?

282
00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.780
These are politics, and you politicians can say many different things too

283
00:20:23.780 --> 00:20:28.780
I want to add that there are things, which are not discussed, but they are even more serious than Syria and Iraq

284
00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.100
I'm talking about Pakistan and Bahrain

285
00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:38.100
If Iran stops their actions, Pakistan will simply blow up, and Bahrain will add more tension too

286
00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.260
When was it a problem for the USA?

287
00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:51.260
It's a miracle for them. In case of a conflict all money will flow to the quiet and peaceful USA

288
00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:58.460
You are not fair, Vladimir (host). You think that all evil things in this world happen because of Donald Trump

289
00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:03.180
You are copying them! They are sure that all the evil comes from here

290
00:21:03.180 --> 00:21:08.180
I have a different logic. They are making all these things for many years in a row. And it's not because of Trump. I understand that he's just a representative of a bunch of elite people

291
00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:13.580
They want to create chaos

292
00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:18.460
They realized that controlled chaos is the best solution for them.

293
00:21:18.460 --> 00:21:21.780
The USA has a strategy in the Middle East

294
00:21:21.780 --> 00:21:26.780
They are making clear and smart steps. They are not trying to hide them too.

295
00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:31.820
And we are trying to ignore all these things. Making a pokerface, and trying to say that all people and countries are smart and clever.

296
00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.380
The USA says: there are no international institutions

297
00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:40.340
There are no allies, but only servants, who will do whatever we tell them to do.

298
00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:44.820
We don't care about our previous agreements, if such agreements are not beneficial for us today.

299
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:47.140
They are not trying to hide this

300
00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.300
But it's a logic of a normal person, and not a logic of the Doctor Evil.

301
00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:54.300
This is a logic of a country, which is sure in its superior position in all aspects including military.

302
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:57.860
This country is sure that it's exceptional

303
00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:01.020
They are sure that the USA is the source of good power and kindness.

304
00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:03.780
They are sure that all the terrible actions are signs of kindness.

305
00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:08.780
All the evil things are caused not by Donald Trump, but by crazy money, which you mentioned before.

306
00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:14.740
But I wouldn't talk only about money, especially in case with the Middle East, where even the smallest problem is complex and multifaceted.

307
00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:21.980
What can we see? We can see the intention to increase the tension in the region

308
00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:27.340
The actions of Trump are not only an invitation to start the war, but

309
00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:31.300
it's an invitation to chaos and instability

310
00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:34.540
Is he ready to attack Iran?

311
00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:39.540
It can be one of possible scenarios. But there's another scenario, which was tested in Iraq before.

312
00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:44.820
They imposed serious sanctions for 12 years (until 2012)

313
00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:49.140
First sanctions were from the US

314
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:53.780
later Europe joined them too

315
00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.780
and the international sanctions were imposed at the last stage.

316
00:22:55.780 --> 00:23:00.780
What are the key features of the modern sanctions, which were announced by Donald Trump together with the cancellation of the agreement?

317
00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:09.140
They main feature is that these sanctions will be directed not towards Iran, but towards its partners

318
00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:15.460
European?
Yes, European and Asian countries

319
00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.460
many other countries, including China!

320
00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:21.900
And our companies are smart enough not to participate there (irony)

321
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:26.900
Trump wants to attack countries having partnership with Iran

322
00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:33.860
They are not hiding it, and these sanctions will be imposed in the next 180 days.

323
00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:38.460
I have to say that those sanctions are too strict

324
00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.460
As I know, they include finances, oil, machinery and so on

325
00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:43.580
Finances and energy resources...

326
00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:45.580
Not only, they will attach car manufacturers too

327
00:23:45.580 --> 00:23:50.580
Have you been to Iran? It's really scary to use local airlines

328
00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:57.180
Planes are extremely old, and it's still like that

329
00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:03.700
So Iran needs new planes to update their fleet

330
00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.060
But the US sanctions prevent them from doing so

331
00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:11.740
And it will get worse when the USA starts to attack partners of Iran

332
00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:15.700
But European companies will lose billions, won't they?

333
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:20.700
Having no hope for compensation because the USA is really easy about that - wait 6 months, and say bye-bye

334
00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:26.380
The strange thing is that Europe accepts such unacceptable behavior of the US elephant dancing in the pottery shop

335
00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:32.540
That's another problem.
They are not sure if they are ready to agree with them.

336
00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:35.860
They are trying to find a way to make an illusion of sanctions, while keeping their freedom

337
00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:39.060
That's what Macron does these day, trying to avoid obstacles

338
00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:44.060
French economy will be affected more than other countries

339
00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.060
France has an agreement with Iran

340
00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:49.860
to build 100 Airbus planes

341
00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:54.860
The thing is that more than 10% of spare parts for Airbus are made in the USA

342
00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:01.820
Airbus has no right to supply their planes to Iran

343
00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:06.100
France managed to deliver only 2 Airbus planes from 100

344
00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:10.260
It means they can simply forget about this order

345
00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:15.260
How many working places will be lost in France? Those are high-qualified specialists

346
00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:20.580
The next aim is Mercedes. They have already started construction of their factory in Tehran.

347
00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:28.340
How many working places are going to be lost in Germany?

348
00:25:28.340 --> 00:25:33.340
And when this wave will hit Europe back, they have to calculate the losses for such sanctions imposed by the USA.

349
00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:44.300
Elena was right. These sanctions are totally different.

350
00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:49.740
These sanctions will affect Europe too.

351
00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:52.100
And Russia simply can't produce enough planes...

352
00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:53.260
Are you talking about MS21 plane?

353
00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:55.260
China is ready to supply enough planes

354
00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:00.060
That's the problem. We would be happy, but we can't produce so many planes.

355
00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.820
But we can send our buses there, can't we?

356
00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:06.820
We can even add a pair of wings to the bus, and hit it with a leg...

357
00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.020
but it's not going to fly too long.

358
00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:15.020
We can supply cars, buses, trains and carriages. We can supply many other things too.

359
00:26:16.940 --> 00:26:20.820
All we have to do is to forget about sanctions

360
00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:22.700
They exist only in the imagination of the USA.

361
00:26:22.700 --> 00:26:26.980
Do we have to forget about 90+ billion of dollars hidden somewhere in the USA?

362
00:26:26.980 --> 00:26:31.980
We really hope that our Minister of Finances will understand the entire case, and he will get the idea that we need to return our money!

363
00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:41.420
I think that he has to

364
00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:45.860
It seems that you are an optimist, my dear!

365
00:26:45.860 --> 00:26:48.820
I feel that I'm Lenin

366
00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:53.820
His assignment to the new position will confirm all his previous ideas and actions

367
00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:59.060
But we need to discuss it again and again to avoid using such phrases as "financial terrorism"

368
00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:04.860
We need to invite him and ask about his plan of actions

369
00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:10.780
What is the financial program of the new government?

370
00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:15.980
We need to invite and ask. I read their decrees published in May, and I have one question: who's going to implement all of them?

371
00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.380
Oh, I forgot! Mutko will! (Mutko is the Minister of Sport, who's famous with the lack of actions, and his ability to remain in his role despite the scandals).

372
00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:25.380
Mutko will adjust the entire system!

373
00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.500
He we make it "from my heart" (famous phrase of Mutko, when he spoke English using Russian transcription)

374
00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.100
We can send Mutko to Iran, and he will solve all the problems there.

375
00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:36.100
But if we forget about jokes... Angela Merkel called the head of Iran for talks today

376
00:27:38.740 --> 00:27:43.740
She confirmed that Germany is not going to leave the deal, condemning the attack on Israel

377
00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.220
She said that the political behavior of Iran has to be discussed

378
00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:55.220
Macron is hesitant too, and this is a magic time for our diplomacy!

379
00:27:56.900 --> 00:28:00.100
Russia and China can benefit from it!

380
00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:03.580
Deputy MFA Sergey Repko is in Tehran right now exactly for the mentioned reason.

381
00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.700
This is not true... Macron and Merkel, they are...

382
00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:12.500
We need to change "politic" program with "ballistic" program

383
00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:17.500
There are two layers. Europe is trying to look hesitant, but they are saying that Iran can't do anything in order not to offend Europe. So it's just another trick.

384
00:28:30.420 --> 00:28:35.420
Europe will continue pushing Iran to avoid making any decisions or actions.

385
00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:41.100
They will say: relax, don't do anything, maybe it will be solved really soon

386
00:28:41.180 --> 00:28:45.580
They are saying: "Oh, honey, you need to wait, and everything will fade away."

387
00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:49.620
By doing so they make things even worse for Iran

388
00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:54.220
One of the leaders of Iran said that Europe won't be able to hold the situation

389
00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.700
Europe won't be able to hold the USA, so the agreement is doomed even today,

390
00:28:57.700 --> 00:29:00.420
I know why they can't use the same model with Iran

391
00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:05.420
Because Merkel and Macron are holding talks with Ruhani

392
00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:11.860
While the spiritual leader is responsible for the nuclear field

393
00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:17.140
He has already said that they don't believe Europe too

394
00:29:17.260 --> 00:29:20.940
So we are going to answer immediately when these measures are implemented

395
00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:25.060
We need to have a break now, and then we can continue our discussion

396
00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:37.620
We need to understand that all actions of Trump are made to enforce the positions of the Conservative Party

397
00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:46.140
in Iran. When they discussed the nuclear program of Iran in Vienna

398
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:52.620
Ruhani as a president, Zarif as a foreign minister - they both represent reformers

399
00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:59.860
Conservative party was blaming them for agreements with USA and Europe

400
00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:04.060
Now all these reformers will leave the stage

401
00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:09.060
The stage will be taken by more conservative extremists, who will use harsh methods against the USA

402
00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.900
If we look at the attacks of Israel against Syria

403
00:30:15.900 --> 00:30:20.900
Everything happened when parties tried to find an agreement on the future of the southwest of Syria, or so-called de-escalation zone

404
00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:27.980
Israel wants both Iran and Hezbollah to leave that region

405
00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:32.980
It's still a form of dialog. But today we need to understand what's going to happen next?

406
00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:37.700
The next question is the role of Turkey in the north of Syria

407
00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:42.700
So this temporary union of Russia, Turkey and Iran

408
00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:47.740
is under attack now. All actions of the USA are directed to destroy it because they failed to do so in the political field.

409
00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:58.260
All political things about Syria are moving to Astana from Geneva

410
00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:00.780
Both USA and Europe don't like that

411
00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:04.180
So they are using military ways to change this situation

412
00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:08.180
If conservative forces take power in Iran

413
00:31:08.180 --> 00:31:10.740
there'll be hell to pay

414
00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:15.740
Trump wrote that 5 leaders of ISIS were arrested a couple of days ago

415
00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:21.060
Turkey arrested one of the leaders, and sent him to Iraq

416
00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:26.060
They used specific smartphone applications

417
00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:31.140
it's called Telegram, to find three more allies in Baghdad

418
00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:36.820
who were responsible for all financial question. Turkish and US Special Forces have already arrested them.

419
00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:44.740
I think they will end this Book of ISIS, and will start a new story for Shias

420
00:31:47.060 --> 00:31:52.060
They will try to explode Iran using ultraconservative forces, and adding some Marxism there too

421
00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:58.140
Because they can use Kurds as the foundation for such movement

422
00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:03.140
So they will use such a sly way, combining forces of Kurds and Shias

423
00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:08.700
They won't be able to end this "Book" really fast, because the USA needs ISIS

424
00:32:12.260 --> 00:32:17.260
They need it not only as an enemy, but as a reason to stay in the region.

425
00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:25.020
They can use this "sauce" to cook a lot of dishes

426
00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.340
They can make the very same ISIS from Shias

427
00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:30.580
But where? Iraq will be soon controlled by pro-Iran forces

428
00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:33.540
Hezbollah is in Lebanon now

429
00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:38.540
Syria is looking mostly towards Russia, but there's a lot of people supporting Iran

430
00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:43.580
We had to start our political of Syria many days before!

431
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:44.940
We are working there

432
00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:48.300
The Ministry of Defense is using a really clever approach

433
00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:53.300
They train the elite forces of Syrian army, but we need to work with political elites too

434
00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:58.260
That's what the center of peace does in Syria

435
00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:03.260
The USA will try to remove Assad, and put someone who likes America

436
00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:11.380
In a year he we say: Russians, go away from here! You were invited by a bloody dictator

437
00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:16.500
The main problem that they don't have such person. If we look at the coalition in Turkey

438
00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:21.500
They've already created a new party in the East of Syria

439
00:33:21.540 --> 00:33:24.860
They don't have enough influence and power in the region!
They will have soon!

440
00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:29.620
They are preparing everything now!
They will bring him from another place like always before.

441
00:33:29.620 --> 00:33:34.620
If we look back in time, the current leaders of Iraq was brought by Iran and USA

442
00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:40.780
In 2003 when US Forces entered Iraq, they were accompanied by Iraqi Shias

443
00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:46.900
So all their scandals are temporary. Something happened now...

444
00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.260
Trump avoided impeachment, and he will get ready for new presidential terms

445
00:33:51.260 --> 00:33:56.260
They don't think like that! The US court blames Shias for the attack

446
00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:01.020
which was made in 2001 by Sunnis.

447
00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:03.220
The idea that Iran paid for it schizophrenic!

448
00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.820
Everybody understands that!

449
00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:09.340
But the US court is schizophrenic enough to make such decisions

450
00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:13.900
Iran is not Libya, and it's not Iraq

451
00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.420
Trump doesn't really care about that

452
00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:20.500
There's a popular joke in Tehran and Damascus

453
00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:24.140
This is a very suspicious joke, and they use it only when they talk about the Russian politics

454
00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:26.900
They say - wait until the end of the World Cup

455
00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:31.580
They predict that Russia will change its behavior right after it

456
00:34:31.580 --> 00:34:35.340
What about economy? Do we have to wait until the end of World Cup too?

457
00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.420
Unfortunately, yes!

458
00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:39.900
We have new parliament now

459
00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:43.340
Now we are connecting to the city of Tel Aviv to talk with Yakov Kedmi

460
00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:46.660
I'm really happy to hear and to see you Yakov

461
00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:50.100
Hello and good evening!

462
00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:52.540
I'm happy to hear you, but I don't see you now

463
00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:57.540
Could you tell us if we have to wait an attack from the USA towards Iran?

464
00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:03.220
What are the consequences of this deal cancellation, and what's the level of Tension in the Middle East?

465
00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:11.300
There are 2 main problems: first of all, the things, which Trump has already started

466
00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:16.300
He's using a typically America approach

467
00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:23.460
They use the very same approach towards Russia

468
00:35:23.740 --> 00:35:28.740
They want to create economic pressure, which will result in economic problems

469
00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:33.820
Mad people will destroy the current power and politics, and will be happy to see American marionettes

470
00:35:36.700 --> 00:35:40.980
And people will be told that new power will solve all the economic problems

471
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:45.980
They have no idea about the level of danger when they are trying to use the same approach to Iran

472
00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:52.860
They are too naive to believe that mad people are able to make revolutions

473
00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:59.020
They don't understand that revolution will only happen in a country where the current regime is too weak to control anything

474
00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.020
Iran is totally different

475
00:36:06.020 --> 00:36:11.020
The regime in Iran is powerful land cruel, they are ready to suppress any protests

476
00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:17.660
There's no problem in sending 100-1000 people to Allah

477
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.220
and sending 1000 or 10000 to the jail.

478
00:36:24.220 --> 00:36:26.860
But the USA is not aware of this fact, and we can't change that

479
00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:31.860
So at this stage they are trying to work using the economic pressure

480
00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.580
But they will face a problem with Europe

481
00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:40.580
They need to rape Europe to make them agree to such measures despite their real interests

482
00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:46.300
and they have to implement sanctions against Iran

483
00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:51.300
The USA wants to use economic pressure on Europe, thinking that

484
00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:58.260
for Europe it's more important to save relations with the USA than with Iran

485
00:36:59.060 --> 00:37:04.060
If they continue to blackmail Europe in the economic field, they may reach their evil goals

486
00:37:04.820 --> 00:37:09.820
But all these actions won't change anything in Iran

487
00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:15.420
Trump has already noticed that he can use other methods, but

488
00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.500
they made a big strategic mistake here

489
00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:23.660
Sanctions of the USA will weaken Iran even without Europe

490
00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:28.660
However, weak Iran will be more loyal to Russia, and Russia will get more influence in the region.

491
00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:38.540
It will happen because only Russia (and China) supports Iran

492
00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:44.020
It his case the USA will face another failure. Only Russia will be able to control Iran and affect its behavior.

493
00:37:48.980 --> 00:37:53.980
Can they use deep bombs, and other weapons to attack location where allegedly Iran continues to create nuclear weapons?

494
00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:05.980
First of all, nobody says that Iran is still developing nuclear weapons

495
00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:10.980
People are saying that Iran stopped all works in 2003

496
00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:17.420
Since then they are only trying to enrich Uranium

497
00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:23.420
But the nuclear program was totally terminated

498
00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:27.660
The process of enrichment is also terminated

499
00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:32.660
It was stopped in according with the agreement, which was just terminated by the USA

500
00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:39.140
So today nobody says that Iran continues to develop nuclear weapons

501
00:38:40.620 --> 00:38:45.580
Iran can continue this work only in 7 years, when the agreement is over.

502
00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.300
But there's nothing like that today

503
00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:52.300
In other hand, 4 or 5 years ago Pentagon made the following conclusion

504
00:38:57.660 --> 00:39:02.660
military approach can't be used to terminate nuclear projects of Iran

505
00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:14.020
this problem can be solved only in the political field

506
00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:19.300
even many years ago the USA said that their military intervention would slow the process down, delaying it by 1-2.5 years in total

507
00:39:30.540 --> 00:39:35.540
I quoted Pentagon. And today Iran is really powerful, and the USA have no chances to invade and conquer it

508
00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:46.780
Even at that time CIA gave the following information. I think they say the same today, but Trump pays no attention to their words

509
00:39:50.380 --> 00:39:55.380
CIA says that any external attack on the country will not only not weaken the power, but will make it even stronger!

510
00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:03.620
Consequences of such actions are totally unpredictable. Please note that those are words of CIA, and not my opinion

511
00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:13.780
Such invasion may weaken the position of the USA in the region.

512
00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:22.140
Do we have to wait for another attacks from Israel towards Syria on allegedly Iranian military bases located there?

513
00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:30.020
First of all, 20 Iranian rockets were launched from the territory of Syria

514
00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.140
last night they were sent to Israel

515
00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:39.020
And Israeli air forces had to prevent that attack

516
00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:44.020
So we can't say "allegedly" because those rockets are real, and they can be used to attack countries

517
00:40:45.500 --> 00:40:50.500
But the thing is that the Minister of defense of Israel said that this case is solved

518
00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:57.540
We don't want to continue any military operation

519
00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:04.820
We don't have any aggressive intentions toward Iran, and we don't want to change anything there

520
00:41:07.340 --> 00:41:12.340
The same goes for Syria. If Iran continues to participate in the civil war on the side of Assad, Israel won't be disturbed or worried.

521
00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:27.820
But when Iran tried to use Syria as the base to attack Israel, our country (Israel) had to answer

522
00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:37.700
The same goes for the case when Iran tries to gives dangerous types of weapons to Hezbollah

523
00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:42.900
We have the following situation for today

524
00:41:42.900 --> 00:41:47.900
We made a serious attack on Iranian structures in Syria

525
00:41:49.220 --> 00:41:51.620
Now we need to look at the actions of Iran

526
00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:56.620
If they accept the position of our MOD that the problem is solved, there will be no further actions

527
00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:04.580
If they decide to make an answer, we will be ready to move to the next stage, which may result in a serious war

528
00:42:13.660 --> 00:42:18.660
It happened many time in the Middle East: in 1967

529
00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:24.380
it happened because things went out of control

530
00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:30.180
both sides decided to show their power, naively thinking that there would be no war

531
00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:35.540
at the end they had to start the war because there were no other options

532
00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:39.780
the same scenario can be used here, and I want to remind you one thing

533
00:42:39.780 --> 00:42:44.780
leaders of the Middle East are always thinking that any military actions or wars won't be successful for them

534
00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:55.340
but they are too hysterical, so they can't avoid the war

535
00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:58.540
keeping the domestic instability in mind

536
00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:03.540
so there are high chances that the first attack will be the last one

537
00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:09.580
in other hand, Iran may show their carelessness, and make new attacks, similar to the previous one. This will result in a new war in the Middle East

538
00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:22.620
It's horrible! Thank you, Yakov!

539
00:43:22.620 --> 00:43:24.900
I want to comment his words now

540
00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:29.900
Both USA and Trump don't care if Iran follows the provisions of the nuclear agreement or it does not.

541
00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.020
They don't care if Iran has nuclear weapons or not!

542
00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:43.220
Trump has already defined a long term strategy

543
00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:48.220
And that means he wants to create a new geopolitical situation in the region

544
00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:56.980
and the most dangerous thing is the current talks with Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other monarchies of the region. These talks may be the foundation of a giant catastrophe, which will destroy the Middle East.

545
00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:21.140
THE USA HAVE NO MONEY FOR THE WAR! THEY DON'T HAVE MONEY!

546
00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:23.340
They do!

547
00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:28.340
They have assigned 380 billion dollars to be used in military operations abroad!

548
00:44:32.020 --> 00:44:34.020
They can draw new money!

549
00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:38.940
The entire budget is 600 billion! How can they use this amount abroad?

550
00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.620
They have Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria

551
00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:42.620
They will find "bushes to cut" (they will demand money from other countries)!

552
00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:44.620
You are so naive!

553
00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:47.140
You have a printing machine! You can print any amount of dollars!

554
00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:49.140
How can the money be over? It can't be!

555
00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:53.180
They will take money by involving armies of other countries in the region!

556
00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:56.220
Russia can be out of money, because we don't draw it! But the USA do.

557
00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.220
We draw, but we draw different type of money (irony)

558
00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:03.220
Now let's talk about Russia

559
00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:13.620
USA will do this... USA will do that... We can't guarantee any outcome of their actions!

560
00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:19.860
We have a problem since the 90's. We always think that all words of the USA are 100% guaranteed predictions of the future.

561
00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:30.540
This internal weakness always leads to failures!

562
00:45:30.540 --> 00:45:33.980
It leads to inability of thinking in advance

563
00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:38.340
We gave them an imaginary power, which they don't have at all

564
00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:43.340
We are always ready to lose. They decided! They decided! Maybe they won't be successful? How can you know?

565
00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:51.220
Nobody can predict the result by 100%

566
00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:53.820
The same principle works for the USA

567
00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:58.820
Another moment is that the USA is ready to pay additional money to save their "island" in the Middle East

568
00:45:59.660 --> 00:46:04.660
Their feature is that all mistakes and losses are not fatal for them

569
00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:11.260
Now, a few words about Russia: 1. It brings us closer to Iran

570
00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:16.980
We can't ignore any provocations towards Iran because it's our southern neighbor

571
00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:21.020
We don't have a physical border with it...
Don't forget about China!

572
00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:25.060
But we have a border in Caspian Sea. We have a lot of agreements with them

573
00:46:25.060 --> 00:46:28.340
about Caspian Sea. Some of them are bilateral.

574
00:46:28.340 --> 00:46:33.340
This situation gives us more freedom for maneuvers as in bilateral cooperation, as well as in Syria, because our relations there are not perfect

575
00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:46.940
Talking about the military stuff, it gives us an opportunity to sell more weapons, especially anti-aircraft missile systems

576
00:46:52.620 --> 00:46:57.620
If they need protection in the airspace, we need to benefit from it!

577
00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:03.460
Now about economy. You said that we can't supply enough planes

578
00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:04.700
but we have to

579
00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:09.700
We need to make efforts, and use this situation to make at least something!

580
00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:17.940
There's one small problem...

581
00:47:17.940 --> 00:47:22.140
Russian planes have a significant share of the parts made in the USA

582
00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:24.140
all our planes do have such parts

583
00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:27.180
Such small problems are everywhere!

584
00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:32.180
This is our life! Do we have to solve it in complex?

585
00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:38.220
Do you know the proverb? A willing person is looking for resources, while others are looking for reasons to avoid doing anything!

586
00:47:39.540 --> 00:47:44.540
All these years we were looking for reasons to avoid doing anything to improve our relations with Iran

587
00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:49.900
But now we need to make some efforts!

588
00:47:49.900 --> 00:47:54.900
Furthermore, the oil price is growing. The more aggressive are the USA in the Middle East, the higher is the oil price.

589
00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:02.140
Do you remember that many "professional" experts predicted $6 per oil barrel?

590
00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:08.260
They were predicting a terrible future for us! Saying that we would lose our last pants! They said that $20 was the limit. Now it's almost $80, isn't it?

591
00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:12.100
$76-77

592
00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:17.100
Yes! And they are talking about "totally different results" now

593
00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:23.020
A couple of months ago they claimed that the oil would never reach $100 again!

594
00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:25.460
And now it's almost $80!

595
00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:30.460
So all these predictions are unreliable. They can say that we need to create some alcohol when the sugar gets cheaper

596
00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:38.940
and we need to buy some vodka when the sugar is expensive! - You need to be optimistic even in the worst case!

597
00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:43.940
That's what I'm trying to say! You can find benefits in any situation!

598
00:48:44.580 --> 00:48:47.140
This is a great name for a new book about economics!

599
00:48:47.140 --> 00:48:49.860
This idea about sugar is really brilliant!

600
00:48:49.860 --> 00:48:54.860
All those economical experts are always doing the same! When they are wrong, they start to talk about new unpredictable factors, bla-bla-bla

601
00:48:58.740 --> 00:49:03.740
Hiding their inability to make forecasts, and showing that all these processes are not linear ones!

602
00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:06.660
They don't know such term as volatility

603
00:49:06.660 --> 00:49:11.660
I always thought that this word is missing S letter in the beginning (relates to Russian word сволочь, which means a bastard).

604
00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:18.460
We need to understand that there's an opportunity even in the worst case!

605
00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:23.460
All these attempts of the USA to create chaos allow us understanding all the hidden moments

606
00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:32.500
Not only for us, but for other countries too. Look at Europe! Yes, they are weak now

607
00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:35.420
yes, they are raped

608
00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:39.100
and the USA will try new and new ways to rape them, but

609
00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:42.780
all these things in Iran allow us to establish better relations with them

610
00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:47.780
we need to make some common efforts, using the mutual objects of hate

611
00:49:49.820 --> 00:49:54.100
We can create new fields for talks and communication

612
00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:59.100
Iran has the same level of importance for the USA as Ukraine, maybe it's even more important

613
00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:05.100
Yes, they spend more money for sure!

614
00:50:05.100 --> 00:50:09.260
We need to act! Instead of waiting and saying that the USA creates chaos!

615
00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:13.940
If we continue sitting and waiting like hogs, they will do whatever they want!

616
00:50:17.860 --> 00:50:22.860
Your opinion brings us to the idea of the second line of the control in the Russian economy. But this term is so dangerous for liberals, that I'm scared even to pronounce it.

617
00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.940
But I'm brave enough to say that

618
00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:36.940
The second line of control?

619
00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:41.940
Me and Igor were scared because the second department of KGB (it sounds similar in Russian) was searching for specific information

620
00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:50.020
The first line is the government fighting with the inflation

621
00:50:53.900 --> 00:50:57.420
the second line is used to create strategic development projects

622
00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:02.420
I like the idea to make Russia a gate for Europeans to enter Iran. This idea can bring a lot of money.

623
00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:09.220
I want to say 2 things: 1. The most popular question is related to ISIS. What's going to happen with them?

624
00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:18.340
I think that they won't use only Shias. They will add some Salafis too

625
00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:29.220
in fact, it looks like true. They don't really need Kurds to create something against Iran

626
00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:38.740
All those left-wing politicians are living in Brussels for many years, getting free grants

627
00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:44.940
So the question where to put all these guys, who were running in the desert, is an important one, and they have to put them somewhere.

628
00:51:48.260 --> 00:51:51.100
The main thing is to avoid bringing them to the Central Asia

629
00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:54.500
And this is a very important question too

630
00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:59.500
Because if we look at the actions of the USA, we can easily see how they managed to surround Caspian Sea

631
00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:06.260
Just look what they did in Kazakhstan, or what they do in such a forgotten country like Turkmenistan

632
00:52:10.340 --> 00:52:15.140
And the second thing, which I want to highlight is that Trump is a great guy!

633
00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:20.140
He created a goal to bring American energy commodities to Europe at any cost

634
00:52:21.700 --> 00:52:25.540
He's doing that! Just look at the sanctions against Iran

635
00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:30.540
Europe, especially France invested a lot of money to the oil and gas sector in Iran

636
00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:40.500
They invested really a lot, and they planned to invest even more

637
00:52:40.740 --> 00:52:45.740
They also wanted to build pipes to deliver oil and gas. But now they can simply forget about their investments

638
00:52:46.420 --> 00:52:51.420
And no we need to understand who will supply enough energy commodities after such a fine tuned argument with Russia?

639
00:52:58.540 --> 00:53:03.540
Who will supply gas? Where can they get it? A lot of nuclear stations are closed all over Europe these days

640
00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:11.460
And they have to replace them with something!

641
00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:15.140
And this temporary increase in oil prices is a great chance for shale gas manufacturers

642
00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:20.140
and for shale oil too! They finally managed to pay their debts off!

643
00:53:20.260 --> 00:53:24.060
They accumulated them for 10 years. So Trump is a great guy!

644
00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:29.060
And we need to learn from him, using his geopolitical and economical logic

645
00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:33.380
He's the best example of the distilled cynicism

646
00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:38.380
And I've never seen anything like that before! Maybe they did the same in the 19th century

647
00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:45.300
They will fail! We can write a book when they fail, and now we need to learn from them.

648
00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:50.540
It's great to put dots above i, but the modern Middle East is a real mine field!

649
00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:04.020
There's not enough space for maneuvers, and Trump makes everything

650
00:54:06.580 --> 00:54:09.820
to start a war between all countries, like it was in the medieval times

651
00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:13.500
in Europe

652
00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:18.500
I can't say it's a disaster now, because things can get much worse

653
00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:24.740
We are talking about Iran and Syria, but we never mentioned Yemen

654
00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:30.540
This country has a lot of Iranian ventures, and Iran will protect it too

655
00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:32.620
We can blame Iran for the things happening in Yemen

656
00:54:32.620 --> 00:54:35.180
We can say that Iran attacks Saudi Arabia

657
00:54:35.180 --> 00:54:40.180
That's why we can wait for tension there, in Lebanon and even in Palestine too

658
00:54:44.300 --> 00:54:48.380
When was the last time when you visited Yemen?

659
00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:53.380
A couple of years ago, but before all the events

660
00:54:53.580 --> 00:54:58.580
I remember your stories about Yemen. You said that there's always some free space for new horrible events

661
00:54:59.700 --> 00:55:04.700
It's a bright country. People are armed, and they always chew some kind of drug with ephedrine

662
00:55:07.580 --> 00:55:11.340
And people are not scared of anything

663
00:55:12.660 --> 00:55:17.660
Do they have some water? They are not interested in water because they have something to chew, and it's more than enough for them.

664
00:55:18.340 --> 00:55:23.340
I don't agree! There's a lot of educated people!

665
00:55:24.060 --> 00:55:29.060
If only they had a sea... actually they have one...

666
00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:34.220
Can someone stop them? I don't think so, but it's possible to use their strategic location to increase the level of tension

667
00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:50.660
Do you remember the Bab-el-Mandeb? It was your favorite name!

668
00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:54.140
Yes, I like it! (it sounds funny in Russian, like a couple of obscene words)

669
00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:56.700
I like it not because of the name, but because of the strategic location

670
00:55:56.700 --> 00:56:01.700
I know that you love it not because of BAB words (rough name for a woman). But they can use it as another reason to blame Iran.

671
00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:09.940
Saudi Arabia will join them too

672
00:56:09.940 --> 00:56:14.940
The first increase of oil prices happened in 2015, when they discussed another war!

673
00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:23.860
Not Israel-Iran war, but about a war between Iran and Saudi Arabia

674
00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:26.420
And it's also possible

675
00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:28.420
And this war is still actively discussed

676
00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:30.420
We have a short break now

677
00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:35.420
What do we have to do? Maybe it's time to return to Bab-el-Mandeb?

678
00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:43.460
Maybe we need to show them the real way? Saying "Guys, if you can't solve it, let us do that"

679
00:56:44.860 --> 00:56:48.900
It will be the third line of control!

680
00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:03.380
We need to understand that new political reality is being created in the Middle East

681
00:57:03.780 --> 00:57:08.620
The short 5-hour local war that happened yesterday

682
00:57:08.620 --> 00:57:13.620
They respected borders before. Israel was making careful attacks, avoiding important objects

683
00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:21.540
Syrians did the same. I say Syrians because...

684
00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:23.540
Carefully is not the right word

685
00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:28.020
Syrians attacked only Holland Heights.

686
00:57:28.020 --> 00:57:33.020
Three Syrians were killed, and Israel said that they asked Syrians to avoid using their air defense

687
00:57:34.980 --> 00:57:38.500
They used their air defense, so we had to suppress them

688
00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:43.500
So they are trying to find a diplomatic way for an excuse

689
00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:48.540
We won't attack Syria if they don't touch us while we are solving our own tasks related to Iraq (probably to Iran, but host said Iraq)

690
00:57:51.060 --> 00:57:56.060
Another question: who attacked occupied Holland Heights?

691
00:57:56.900 --> 00:58:01.900
Syrians claimed they did it, and Iran...

692
00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:05.340
Are you Syrian? Why do you call them occupied?

693
00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:08.980
No, the international law says that

694
00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:13.380
As I know, Israel has a different opinion

695
00:58:13.380 --> 00:58:18.380
They call it a territory in dispute

696
00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:24.540
This attack was the biggest one since 1974

697
00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:28.700
Israel used 28 aircraft to attack it

698
00:58:28.700 --> 00:58:33.700
We need to understand that Russia, Iran and Turkey are three key players in the Middle East

699
00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:44.700
I really love Russia... But if we check the number of equipment and soldiers there... We know how to fight, but the total number is really low

700
00:58:57.780 --> 00:58:59.780
One regiment maybe...

701
00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:03.780
We are working hard but... There enough soldiers because we don't have many things to do there

702
00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:08.780
I know, but I want people to avoid thinking that we have the same number of soldiers as in Afghanistan

703
00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:14.060
We have enough people there! There's a special peaceful center, and it works.

704
00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:19.780
The key task is not to fight, but keep the peace

705
00:59:19.780 --> 00:59:24.780
I think that the USA have much more soldiers and equipment there, haven't they?

706
00:59:26.220 --> 00:59:31.220
They even have Special Forces too

707
00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:33.980
Around 5000

708
00:59:33.980 --> 00:59:38.980
Yes, that's the real number. We have to understand one thing

709
00:59:39.020 --> 00:59:41.020
Officially they have only 2000

710
00:59:41.020 --> 00:59:43.020
But in reality...

711
00:59:43.020 --> 00:59:46.820
They are in Daara and Guta!

712
00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:51.820
A couple of British agents was arrested in Guta, when the Minister of Defense went to Oman

713
00:59:52.940 --> 00:59:57.940
he went to open an embassy there, and Syrians held talks...

714
00:59:59.740 --> 01:00:04.740
I'm wondering if only Russia decreases its military budget among countries presented in the region?

715
01:00:05.260 --> 01:00:09.060
The USA is increasing, Europe is forced to increase

716
01:00:09.060 --> 01:00:11.060
France is pushed to do so

717
01:00:11.060 --> 01:00:14.780
And Russia is proud to announce that we decrease our military presence there

718
01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.780
Saudis are increasing their presence

719
01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:20.500
It seems that all other countries are growing their presence...

720
01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:25.020
And only Russia knows that it's not the right way

721
01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:30.020
We have a lot of financial experts, who told us it's really bad to increase our military presence!

722
01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:37.500
While "stupid" (irony) countries like USA and France are growing their presence there

723
01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:41.540
We are smarter, and we have to be happy!

724
01:00:41.540 --> 01:00:46.540
Soon they will start new military operation in the south of Syria. They have talks with Jordan and with the USA

725
01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:53.620
They want to make a deal, and not a real military operation

726
01:00:53.620 --> 01:00:58.620
After the presidential elections in Turkey, they will start new operation in the north too. Turkey is ready to make a deal to clear the region.

727
01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:08.980
We are talking about ISIS, but we've never noticed Al Qaeda in the form of Al Nousra front, which is more dangerous than ISIS

728
01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:13.860
or so-called Islamic State

729
01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:18.860
This will happen, and we have to find partners, and talk with them, including the USA too

730
01:01:19.980 --> 01:01:24.380
We need to be aware of the fact that the USA is in the region. Maybe they are not too powerful, but they are there

731
01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:29.380
Any confrontation with them will bring a lot of problems, and everybody knows that

732
01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:35.340
We need to understand that Syria is not isolated. We will talk about Iraq, Lebanon

733
01:01:39.540 --> 01:01:43.540
about the creation of apolitical system there

734
01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:45.540
Do they understand that all countries hate each other there?

735
01:01:45.540 --> 01:01:49.660
There's a confessional resistance

736
01:01:49.660 --> 01:01:54.340
I mean that Israel and Syria have no agreement

737
01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:56.340
only cease-fire

738
01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:58.500
All countries are fighting with each other

739
01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:02.380
So, we can say that there's a war between all of them

740
01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:07.380
There's an agreement to return to the borders of 1967

741
01:02:09.420 --> 01:02:13.220
we need only UN resolution. Aha, let's see how they return those borders...

742
01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:17.220
They will run and do everything to return the borders

743
01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:21.860
So they have to make a deal, including the situation with Yemen.

744
01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:24.780
Why is it great for Israel?

745
01:02:24.780 --> 01:02:29.420
Let's imagine that Russia says it wants to return borders of 1976

746
01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:34.300
They will be shocked!

747
01:02:34.300 --> 01:02:39.060
We will cut Europe into parts

748
01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:44.060
They need this conflict. They managed to solve the problem between Arabic countries and Israel

749
01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:49.340
Americans are discussing the deal.

750
01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:51.340
Trump will shoot, and everything will be on fire!

751
01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:53.540
He won't do that!

752
01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:56.860
Jerusalem is the capital...

753
01:02:56.860 --> 01:02:59.100
He's not drinking like I do, but he will attack!

754
01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:04.100
If the USA attack themselves or using Israeli forces...

755
01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:09.580
Israel is independent enough to fight on their own

756
01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:14.580
They will definitely regret about that. One can catch Americans in Afghanistan now

757
01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:18.860
They can be caught in the Gulf too

758
01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:20.860
Who said that?

759
01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:24.100
Trump does! What's important for him?

760
01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:27.660
He's preparing for the 2 term. He prepares for the preliminary elections!

761
01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:32.660
He said that if he loses, he will face the impeachment!

762
01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:37.780
He has two main topics now: 1. North Korea - they promise to give him the Noble Prize, and he's playing a role of a poor boy

763
01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:46.020
and the second topic: if the war starts, and American soldiers start to die, he will say that he's fighting with the evil forces!

764
01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:55.140
I'm the commander of the army that eliminates the evil, and you want to make the impeachment!

765
01:03:55.140 --> 01:04:00.140
How long will he do that? The war with Iran is not the war with Iraq during 15 years under sanctions

766
01:04:02.260 --> 01:04:05.060
They are too far behind the ocean to think about them

767
01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:10.060
If you are right about the elections, we can predict that the attack will have the same character

768
01:04:13.860 --> 01:04:18.860
It can be a simulation... something like...
No, he won't do that!

769
01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:23.940
We can't decide for him! Look at the Syrian attack!

770
01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:29.420
We can discuss, and condemn him here

771
01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:33.580
While people in the USA are not even worried about that

772
01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:38.580
Maybe only some experts are able to discuss it in the USA, while the majority doesn't care!

773
01:04:41.780 --> 01:04:46.780
Media create an image of a successful attack, saying that Trump and his allies made an efficient attack!

774
01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:56.180
He can do the same for Iran or forces of Iran in Syria, why not?

775
01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:02.860
I don't believe in the big war between the USA and Iran, they can't hold it!

776
01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:10.180
But they can make a simulation, in order to show that Trump is a powerful president, who's not scared of anything!

777
01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:23.340
So they can do something like that. And if Trump gets the Noble Prize, we can flush that academy to the toilet once and forever!

778
01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:36.540
No, I don't agree with you!

779
01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:42.020
There's another problem! No money? No, there was a sexual scandal, and they decided to avoid giving the Noble Prize in the field of literature

780
01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:54.060
So Trump has to deal with the... how they call it... an actress of a free genre!

781
01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:01.300
Free artist! She has 2 higher educations!

782
01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:04.660
A lady with low social responsibility

783
01:06:04.660 --> 01:06:09.660
I want to repeat that this situation allows us to create a foundation to restore our relations with Europe!

784
01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:21.460
We have to use it. Not only in a political and public ways, but...

785
01:06:21.460 --> 01:06:26.460
Russia can become an intermediate between Iran and Europe

786
01:06:29.980 --> 01:06:33.940
We need to work in the economical field!

787
01:06:33.940 --> 01:06:38.220
I don't say it's going to be successful, but we need to try!

788
01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:43.220
Especially when they say that Europe ignores us. We have a lot of topics to discuss!

789
01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:50.580
You are using reframing - looking at difficult issues from a different point of view

790
01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:55.580
We need to be more flexible, and use this chance!

791
01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:03.860
I want to say that all things in the Middle East are not just a catastrophe; otherwise we could cry like mourners in the Bab-el-Mandeb.

792
01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:17.780
It's an opportunity to become an intermediate, and save our partners!

793
01:07:22.180 --> 01:07:27.180
We need to improve relations between Russia, Iran and Turkey

794
01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:34.140
We need to keep this format. The USA will play against all countries

795
01:07:36.420 --> 01:07:41.420
They will try to create chaos, destroying even the unions created by Moscow too

796
01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:48.780
That's why we need to work with Europe! About Turkey

797
01:07:51.260 --> 01:07:56.260
Turkey is really worried with the things happening with Iran. It's not something pleasant for them!

798
01:07:59.820 --> 01:08:04.820
Unlike Saudi Arabia and Israel. Why? Let's remember Zbignev Bjezinski

799
01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:10.980
He wrote many years ago that Iran has to be moved to the pro-Western world

800
01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:18.500
Iran was like that before the revolution of 1979

801
01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:23.740
And the USA is responsible for all further changes!

802
01:08:23.740 --> 01:08:28.740
Yes, they are... They brought Ruhollah Khomeini from Paris

803
01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:34.060
Israel asked them to solve the problem on their own

804
01:08:34.060 --> 01:08:38.940
And the USA said: don't touch him!

805
01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:43.940
It was told by Yakov Kedmi, but I read memoirs of another worker of Israeli Special Forces

806
01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:49.860
I'm talking about Eliezer Tsafrir

807
01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:54.860
He was the president of Iranian Mossad before 1979

808
01:08:55.780 --> 01:09:00.780
He told me the story about French president Olivier Giscard d'Estaing

809
01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:07.580
He offered to make something (like kill) Khomeini on the territory of France

810
01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:15.500
But the Shah refused, because he was a bit shy person in such things

811
01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:22.380
And I don't agree with Yakov Kedmi when he says that people make no sense. He's sure that all things are done by Special Forces.

812
01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:37.020
In 1979 they couldn't predict that people would flood the streets

813
01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:40.140
He's saying about the weakness of the regime

814
01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:45.140
People in the streets had their own opinion and will

815
01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:51.940
Maybe it was his idea too. I want to say that Israel will be happy to restore their positions in Iran in case

816
01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:58.860
If something happens

817
01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:03.860
I want to finish my idea about Turkey. Zbignev Bjezinski wrote that Iran has to be pro-Western due to many reasons

818
01:10:06.780 --> 01:10:11.780
One of them was to balance the growing power of Turkey

819
01:10:12.260 --> 01:10:17.260
It reminds me movies about fantastic world when a hero

820
01:10:20.980 --> 01:10:25.980
needs to step on a specific tiles on the floor

821
01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:30.180
It's called a bull in a china shop.. No, it's not the same

822
01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:32.180
It's a mystery of the Pyramid. Yes!

823
01:10:32.180 --> 01:10:37.180
The USA never says obvious things. They did everything to fire the Middle East

824
01:10:37.380 --> 01:10:42.380
They made it by invading Iraq. People told them not to do that!

825
01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:45.780
Yes, they gave more power to Iran in 2003

826
01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:50.780
They destroyed the balance with Iran, which resulted in a catastrophe

827
01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:53.980
They brought Shias to the government

828
01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:58.940
They created a Shia half-moon

829
01:10:58.940 --> 01:11:03.900
They were told not to touch Lebanon, but they ignored that too. Okay...

830
01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:08.260
They decided to attack Libya... What did they do there?

831
01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:13.260
First France, and then the USA. They were told that the entire Africa would go to Europe

832
01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:20.420
All Libyan weapons were spread around the Middle East

833
01:11:20.420 --> 01:11:25.420
Kaddafi took everything under control.

834
01:11:25.420 --> 01:11:27.780
They were fighting for the democracy. But where is it?

835
01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:31.260
None of the invaded countries has democracy now! And they won't have!

836
01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:34.180
They are scared to walk in Afghanistan.

837
01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:39.180
Lebanon has democracy. It's not democracy, but a will to get more money!

838
01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:44.780
Iran will be another terrible catastrophe

839
01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:49.780
All of you have an opinion, which looks false for me.

840
01:11:53.940 --> 01:11:58.940
You say that the USA will spend a lot of money, weapons and people to increase their presence in the Middle East

841
01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:10.380
You say they will continue investing a lot of money there

842
01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:14.580
I haven't finished yet!

843
01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.940
Those countries paid enough. The USA can't get more

844
01:12:18.940 --> 01:12:23.940
I think they will leave the Middle East in order to get the Far East

845
01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:31.060
Never!

846
01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:33.980
They key threat for them is China!

847
01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:35.980
It looks really strange

848
01:12:35.980 --> 01:12:40.980
Today China can use their submarines in South China Sea to destroy the entire USA with nuclear weapons. It's the first time in history!

849
01:12:47.660 --> 01:12:52.660
Who are neighbors of China in the Far East? Russia! Who else? Vietnam...

850
01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:55.900
Burma... India....

851
01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:59.900
India! There are many jungles

852
01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:04.900
China has a problem with free areas, so if the USA fires all countries along the borders, they will create a lot of problems for them.

853
01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:17.020
You are right, but you forgot one thing!

854
01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:21.020
It can only happen if they have enough money to do that!

855
01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:26.020
The USA have a lot of money, but you are wrong saying that they can print any amount of them!

856
01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:36.420
They are close to a financial catastrophe!

857
01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:40.700
What is the main form of it? They won't be able to fulfill their obligations!

858
01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.460
Obligations to?

859
01:13:42.460 --> 01:13:42.700
China and Russia!
Obligations to?

860
01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:44.700
China and Russia!

861
01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:49.700
What are we going to say? Give our money back?

862
01:13:50.820 --> 01:13:55.820
We will, and they won't be able to return. I've never seen such a brave country.

863
01:13:57.140 --> 01:14:02.140
Russia refused to give the US money in 1997.

864
01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:04.380
He's a real optimist among us!

865
01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:09.060
We had a default, and we had to return all the money

866
01:14:09.060 --> 01:14:14.060
By saying that they want and they will add more power to the Middle East, you need to give some facts

867
01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:24.100
I'm sure that they will even decrease their presence there because they have no money now

868
01:14:25.740 --> 01:14:29.860
If the USA have no money... Who has it?

869
01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:31.860
China!

870
01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:36.860
We need to remember that the state debt of the USA is mostly owned by corporate and social structures within the USA.

871
01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:45.260
So our 100 billion are not too dangerous for them

872
01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:52.740
I think that the most important thing is that the USA want to created new Big Middle East, and they have a detailed plan

873
01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:06.580
In Russian it's called chaos. They will leave, but they will leave to come back soon.

874
01:15:09.740 --> 01:15:14.740
They will leave for a while, because they still have a chance to "suck" half of a trillion there

875
01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:18.620
especially from Saudi Arabia and UAE

876
01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:23.620
They will leave to come and make so-called reconstruction

877
01:15:29.460 --> 01:15:34.180
Will they hit Iran now? Yes, they will

878
01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:39.180
And the question is the following: What will Russia bring to that "table"?

879
01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:46.900
We need a program to balance that chaos

880
01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:52.860
I think that our Big Eurasia will balance the Big Middle East of the USA

881
01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:03.580
They see that we are expanding our presence, working with China

882
01:16:08.540 --> 01:16:13.540
with Iran, we took the leadership in Syria

883
01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:19.340
so all our projects in Iran: development of Bushehr, the power plant in Bandar Abbas

884
01:16:25.260 --> 01:16:30.260
we will provide electricity for the railroad from Tehran to the north

885
01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:35.620
we have to develop them! We started talks with China.

886
01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:40.620
About the Big Silk Road in order to combine our projects

887
01:16:40.860 --> 01:16:45.860
We have to expand! I share Sergey's opinion that it's a great chance for us!

888
01:16:46.940 --> 01:16:51.940
We need to hold Europe in all integration processes in the Central Asia and Big Eurasia

889
01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:03.900
First of all, I'm talking about Iran

890
01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:08.900
We need to use the chaos created by the USA in the political, diplomatic and military levels

891
01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:20.660
We need to improve our position, working with the countries, which support the project of Big Eurasia

892
01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:31.260
And we need to invite Europe to create new Big Europe keeping in mind the decision of Trump to leave the agreement!\

893
01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:40.220
We have this chance!

894
01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:45.220
If the USA attacks Iran, we can use it to improve our geopolitical role in the region

895
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:55.500
Do you know that space is the antonym for chaos?

896
01:17:59.380 --> 01:18:03.660
So we need to create the space!

897
01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:08.660
So we need to create new Universe from Vladivostok and Vietnam to Arkhangelsk!

898
01:18:09.980 --> 01:18:14.980
We need to use this great opportunity!

899
01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:20.740
We need to do something instead of empty talks!

900
01:18:20.740 --> 01:18:25.740
I hope our new government will understand the key direction, instead of speculating in financial markets!

901
01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:35.540
They need to stop investing Russian money to the USA!

902
01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:39.580
They will be surprised, I'm sure!

903
01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:44.340
They (government) need to watch this program! They need to come here and tell their plans!

904
01:18:44.340 --> 01:18:49.340
We need to close this part, and I want to remind that new laws about sanctions include three countries

905
01:18:50.700 --> 01:18:54.940
North Korea, Iran and Russia

906
01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:59.940
You need to look at Iran, and understand that one day they will find enough time to implement all of them in Russia.

907
01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:11.020
And we need to know that this problem won't just fade away or disappear.

908
01:19:15.980 --> 01:19:17.980
It will not

909
01:19:17.980 --> 01:19:22.980
And we have to solve new and different tasks

910
01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:30.260
I saw new government, and I won't comment, because I want to see their actions

911
01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:35.500
and real terms. So people can ask about the preliminary results and completed stages.

912
01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:43.980
we have no time to prepare ourselves. The level of danger is really high!
