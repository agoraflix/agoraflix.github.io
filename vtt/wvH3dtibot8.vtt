00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
The Evening with Vladimir Soloviev

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.780
Donald Trump ordered Mike Pompeo to create new list of sanctions against Russia

3
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.940
We are not surprised. Furthermore, EU will also think about the prolongation of sanctions against Russia.

4
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.780
However, the Europe may soon face the limitations from the USA itself!

5
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.100
But they are trying to say that the USA can't be a financial police for the entire planet

6
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.420
The world of politics has degrade to the level of mutual sanction attacks.

7
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.340
We can't find an agreement with Trump, and it's obvious that we won't be able to do this in the future.

8
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.780
But the position of Europe reminds me an old Ukrainian joke

9
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.780
<v ->Where are you going, Mikola? - I will try to find a Moskal (offensive name for Russians) in order to shoot him!</v>

10
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.980
<v ->And what if he shoots you? - Why would he do that to me??</v>

11
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.980
So it turns out to be that European sanctions against Russia are more than OK

12
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.660
and now when they are ready to face sanctions for the cooperation with Iran, they are trying to say: "Wait! We didn't agree like that!"

13
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.220
We are your friends! Yes, yes!

14
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.220
It sounds so kind, but Europe has a really difficult situation now. For example, Tusk says the following

15
00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.420
It can't be the truth! While Macron has already understood everything

16
00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.420
He said that France is not going to have a trade war with the USA.

17
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.700
And it's really funny to see that the USA plans to impose new sanctions again and again

18
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.260
I can repeat this sentence every single day because the USA is not hiding it anymore...

19
00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.300
Recently they told that they don't like the North Stream 2. Maybe they don't like it because they want to supply their shale oil to Europe?

20
00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.740
They told that they don't like it due to several political and energetic reasons.

21
00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.620
In other words, they've lost the last drops of shame these days

22
00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.820
About the North Stream 2... It was Sandra Oudkirk...

23
00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.260
She's a Deputy Assistant in the Energy Bureau of the State Department of the USA

24
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.260
She said that the North Stream 2 is a real threat to the safety of Europe

25
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.300
She says about the energetic threat, and the need to diversify energy resources

26
00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.300
And Europe wants to follow her advice because they plan to build new terminals to received gas from the USA

27
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.820
So why wouldn't the USA impose these sanctions... especially keeping in mind the position of Europe

28
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.060
I want to say that Europe has significantly degraded during the last years. They approved two acts in 1996

29
00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:43.460
I'm talking about the Helms-Burton Act, and Dea Meite (unclear) Act, which imposed sanctions for trading with Iran

30
00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.740
and Cuba. Those were two Acts, which imposed new sanctions in the field of trading.

31
00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.740
But at that time Europe managed to do something. They consolidated their efforts, and approved a blocking act

32
00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.380
which allowed European companies to ignore sanctions imposed by the USA against them.

33
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.060
Will Europe do the same today? As we know, Macron has already told us that France is not going to start the war of sanctions with the USA

34
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:19.020
Otherwise, some people may think that we are an ally of Iran

35
00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:23.060
Ayatollah can't approach Macron and take some dandruff off

36
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.060
After more than 20 years we can see that the USA managed to put Europe in a very complex position

37
00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.060
Trump just "renders the bills". Obama was soft, and he tried to do the same, but in a very different manner

38
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.940
Trump is a direct man. He says that Europe has to pay for the safety by providing the most favorable conditions for American business

39
00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.300
There's no surprise in this situation because when you want to exchange your sovereignty for something else, ignoring they key elements of independence

40
00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.020
By giving your safety to the hands of a totally different country, you will get exactly the same results

41
00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:21.660
So there's no surprise here...

42
00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.700
I think that we are talking not about new sanctions, but about a new and long period of protectionism

43
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:34.500
and economical nationalism

44
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.500
Trump became the President, and he did something really incredible, i. e. he started to do what he promised before the elections

45
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.820
And I have to say that he's pretty successful in this field

46
00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.820
I want to say that only his promises resulted in the restoration of the working places and fast growth of the economy

47
00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.780
We can see that his harsh action towards Europe and China don't lead to a catastrophe with those key partners

48
00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.260
The commodity circulation increased by 13% (between China and USA)

49
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.260
Donald calls Chinese President "his friend" by saying that "My friend and I are going to discuss something now"

50
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.780
We can see the rough way of interaction, which can result in new agreements with the more favorable conditions for the industrial companies in the USA

51
00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.460
What can we do? We can complain a lot, saying how bad they are. We can also make some conclusions from this case.

52
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.540
We need to understand that we entered the new era of protectionism, and we have to adjust our own behavioral models

53
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.580
We need to forget about the limitless appellations to the principles of free trade

54
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:04.420
We need to become a tough protectionist of our own industrial companies...

55
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:09.420
Don't do what the USA say, but do the same what they do, am I right?

56
00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:14.420
Yes, you are! There's a proverb about the USA. It was used in the USA towards British people

57
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:22.780
Don't listen British people, but look what they do

58
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:28.180
It was relevant because Great Britain was always talking about free trade, using incredibly harsh protectionism to help their own industrial companies.

59
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.940
That was a very "funny time", when the Minister of Finances could be killed by a vice prime-minister, and nobody would be arrested.

60
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.180
Hamilton told that they needed to stop that foolishness, and imposed incredible protectionist measures.

61
00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.860
And that was the day when the USA became an industrial state

62
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.860
Do you know that the famous quote about the "invisible hand of the market" was told as a praise?

63
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.500
Smith wanted to praise the protectionism of King Henry.

64
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.500
He said that such measures will create an "invisible hand", which will lead the industrial companies to success.

65
00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:11.060
So the first thing we have to do is to forget about three letters: W, T, and O

66
00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:16.060
I was afraid that you were going to prohibit people to use obscene words (the most famous Russian word consists of 3 letters).

67
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:20.300
I'm not as radical as you may think, Vladimir.

68
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.300
It's impossible! (about the bad words)

69
00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:27.300
We have it in our subconsciousness. If you want to call it, you need to drop a brick on your foot, and forgotten words will come out automatically.

70
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:37.620
We need to forget about WTO! What else?

71
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:42.620
WTO says that they rules may be eliminated in case of a war or another emergency situations

72
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.940
And now we have such an emergency case!

73
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:59.460
How many times have you heard that Russian economy was adjusted to sanctions?

74
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.700
It's not good or bad, it's just wrong! We don't have to think that...

75
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:10.980
we are able to adjust to all new changes. This strategic battle is developing every single day

76
00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:18.860
We are talking not about sanctions, but about the war of sanctions

77
00:08:18.860 --> 00:08:23.860
And what's the difference between the war and a long camping in the mountains?

78
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:29.860
During the war a conscious enemy is watching your actions, preparing adequate responses for each of them

79
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:37.540
And these sanctions are not just onetime measures, but a real war that will continue for many days and years in a row

80
00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:46.820
So we need to think not only about the current day, but also about all the next steps in this difficult game.

81
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:52.060
You know that I have my own opinion about sanctions.
I know that you are against them.
Yes.

82
00:08:55.980 --> 00:09:00.980
I want to say that we are using this word, which came from the political vocabulary of the USA

83
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:08.700
This term may include virtually anything: tariff regulations, import and export restrictions

84
00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:17.260
limitations in the field of trade and finances for many countries

85
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.580
I think that each and every country in the world has this mechanism

86
00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:30.580
We call is "sanctions", but even Russia has it, as well as many other small countries, which have to build relations with their neighbors

87
00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:37.060
Just the USA are big, and when they impose something, all countries are affected

88
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:42.060
Russia did the same thing many times! You can use a different word, but just remember that one day Russia didn't like wine from Georgia

89
00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:48.820
The USA tries to apply their rules on the territory of different countries, and that's the difference

90
00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:53.820
I remember the law on the special economic rules, which was approved in 2006... Maybe I'm wrong, and experts will tell the exact date.

91
00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.980
Those are not sanction, but can bring a lot of benefits

92
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:03.980
The USA created the foundation for sanctions in the 70's.. It was a normal thing during the Cold War, and it didn't cause any problems

93
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:11.780
Both the USSR and the USA imposed numerous limitations... As a liberal, I'm against any limitations, including the field of trading

94
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:20.180
But we need to be realists... Any politician will protect their market by using the law available in the country

95
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:27.180
I agree that the USA has a developed system of sanctions, and Russia needs to do the same in order to create required laws to protect its interests.

96
00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:37.780
We are living in this reality for the last 2-3 centuries... various limitations, WTO and so on

97
00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:53.660
We didn't use "sanction" word, but we had to choose reliable partners and so on

98
00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:59.540
I want to say that all kinds of Opium Wars and gunboat diplomacy were just another forms of the sanction wars

99
00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.220
You are trying to change the history and use wrong terms now

100
00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:09.220
Do you think that fees implemented to protect the production of aluminum can be called sanctions?

101
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:15.700
Sanctions are direct actions towards another country or its companies in order to change the policies

102
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:23.900
I want to say that the Opium Wars and gunboat diplomacy were exactly the same!

103
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:28.900
I want to say that they are trying to limit something, saying that all limitations can be withdrawn in case if another country makes desired actions

104
00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:39.380
All economical measures are intended to improve your position and undermine the position of your enemy... You can make any other political conclusions.

105
00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:45.380
Such actions can even lead to the change of power, and it happens once in a while too!

106
00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.460
Do you remember Cuba or Iran?

107
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:54.460
Did it change in Cuba? Yes, of course after many years of the blockade.

108
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:59.620
Okay, I agree that Cuba was a wrong example, but can I continue, please?

109
00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.620
I still think that Cuba lost, and they will become a close partner of the USA during the following dozens of years.

110
00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:12.460
And there will be no communism there for sure! However...

111
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:17.460
I can understand when sanctions are imposed due to various economical reasons... but when they use political reasons without any will to protect their companies or businesses, I have a problem in my mind...

112
00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:32.260
In other hand, what else can they use except sanctions in this case?

113
00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:37.620
What can they do to answer the actions of their enemies? Do they have to send the army or make bombings?

114
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.180
This is even worse!

115
00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:43.180
The USA do that too!
Not only the USA!

116
00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.260
Look at this world! It's not only the USA!

117
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:52.260
I don't like that we don't have the order, and each country does what it wants!

118
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.460
What do we have to do in this case?

119
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:59.460
I think that Russia needs to do the same... You need to create required laws, and avoid using reactive policies, choosing proactive instead

120
00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:11.980
Russia needs to be a leader in the new world of economy and policy!

121
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:17.020
It's not like that today because people are still worried about the reaction to the US sanctions

122
00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:22.020
And Russia needs to impose such measures or sanctions to get benefits. The USA get really a lot from each stage of sanctions!

123
00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:29.780
Why can't Russia use it? This mechanism is legal and acceptable!

124
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.420
The UN also uses the very same mechanisms, and not only the UN!

125
00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.420
You forgot that initially only the UN was allowed to impose all kinds of sanctions!

126
00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:44.340
You are wrong, Vladimir!

127
00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:49.340
I want to say that the previous president, Barak Obama, tried to hide all his actions under the sauce of democracy

128
00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:58.620
Trump is not even trying to do the same! He acts like an elephant in a China shop...

129
00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:05.780
And sanctions is the way to adjust the US policies to the rapidly changing conditions of the world

130
00:14:10.140 --> 00:14:15.140
Why are Russia and Europe are always under new sanctions? Especially Russia... Because the American establishment doesn't like that we don't want to listen to them, creating our own system of the rules.

131
00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:30.700
That's why they will continue implementing new and new limitations again and again

132
00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.180
You've told us about the Opium Wars and gunboat diplomacy

133
00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:42.180
Today it's a policy of aircraft carriers. The USA use their army to solve political issues, and not economic ones.

134
00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:50.620
They want to suppress weak countries, defeat strong ones, creating their own rules... That is the foundation of the modern US policy

135
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:58.780
I totally agree with Mister Zlobin that we don't have to react on the actions of the USA. Actually the Kremlin does exactly what it has to do!

136
00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:10.900
I don't know if it's a result of the US sanctions, but Russian fleet with aerodynamic Caliber missiles will be located in the Mediterranean Region on the permanent basis

137
00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:26.820
Whether you like it or not, you need to know that! I also think that we need to improve our political, economical and military cooperation with China.

138
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:39.540
And we need to avoid making everything to please China. We need to protect our own interests!

139
00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:46.740
Now we can see that China created a giant ocean fleet in order to resist the hegemony of the USA in the southern seas

140
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:56.820
We need to highlight that Russia supports such behavior of China, and understands that China wants to protect its sovereignty.

141
00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:08.780
We expect that the new block of sanctions against the defense industry on the ground of alleged violations of the agreement on short- and intermediate- range missiles usage

142
00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:26.780
will be imposed really soon, and we are sure in that!

143
00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:32.740
The Law on military budget for 2018 contains all this information.
Yes, we know this, it's not something new!

144
00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:39.660
And I think that it's a big problem that the US intelligence failed to find any evidence that Russia tested missiles prohibited by the agreement on short- and intermediate- range missiles usage during the examination of Iskander-M complex.

145
00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:04.220
The USA needs is only for one reason. They need to create a long range aerodynamic missile, and such plans are included in the military budget of the USA

146
00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:17.300
They plan to spend just 58-60 million USD, but we need to understand that it's just the first stage

147
00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.740
The USA is ready to amend and cancel any rules if such changes can bring profits or benefits for them

148
00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:32.020
When the USA need to evolve technologies like it happened in case with the air defense agreement in 1972, they simply forget such agreements as useless

149
00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:42.860
That's why we need to understand the modern world. It's tough and competitive, but it's not hopeless

150
00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:50.260
We need to create long- or short term partnerships with countries, which are not happy with the actions and policies of the USA

151
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:06.020
I always remember the presidential campaign of Donald Trump. I was shocked with one of its moments

152
00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:11.220
Someone asked him a question about the giant national debt of the USA, and he said that USA owes nothing, while other countries do owe a lot!

153
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:20.060
It reminds me the 90's in Russia! People were saying: "I forgive all my creditors now!"

154
00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:28.620
He said that the USA hadn't received enough money in the frames of Marshall's Plan. He said that Western Europe hadn't paid enough

155
00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:39.820
We paid 18 billion, and we had the interest rate for these years, and we will use it as a source of money for the USA

156
00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:45.620
And now I understand that Donald Trump wants to dictate everything, including the situation with the North Stream 2. Just look at him!

157
00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:56.220
Just look how he talks with Europe! He tells what he wants, and squeezes them financially.

158
00:19:01.300 --> 00:19:06.300
When Angela Merkel tried to explain that the USA don't have enough tankers, and it's not smart to buy gas from the USA, he said that Germany wants to support Russia.

159
00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:17.220
He's a real businessman, and he knows how to get profits. That's why he's so successful in this field.

160
00:19:24.180 --> 00:19:29.180
We need to understand something about sanctions. I remember how Clinton said that the USA spent a lot of money to win in the Cold War (he said it in 1995).

161
00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:45.340
He said that the USA reached goals, which couldn't be reached by Truman, who used a nuclear bomb.

162
00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:52.980
They spent a lot of money to destroy the USSR, and suddenly Russia appears on their map again!

163
00:19:56.780 --> 00:20:01.780
Trump can't accept the fact that Russia is developing right now!

164
00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:08.380
He does the same mistake as the USSR at the end of the Cold War. The USSR decided to be an independent country, breaking ties with China. As a result we had to participate in two giant wars at the same time.

165
00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:26.100
In the West and in the East - with China and with the USA!

166
00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:31.100
Trump may face the same problems because he are too strict with both Russia and China at the same time

167
00:20:40.620 --> 00:20:45.620
You've just told about the agreement on short- and intermediate- range missiles usage. The USA want to terminate it.

168
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:55.140
The USA can simply supply weapons to Taiwan, thus affecting China

169
00:20:55.700 --> 00:20:59.420
They can also create something in South Korea too!

170
00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:04.420
Even though they have great relations, China was mad when the USA wanted to supply weapons to Taiwan.

171
00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:12.780
We need to wait until these promises are real... and now those are rumors

172
00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:17.500
Trump is really smart in this case...

173
00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:19.500
Have you finished your speech?

174
00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:24.500
I want to agree that the USA wants to accuse Russia in order to leave the agreement on short- and intermediate- range missiles usage.

175
00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:34.900
They need it to suppress China by placing these missiles in Taiwan.

176
00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:41.060
We made a terrible mistake with this agreement in 1987... probable we had no real experts at that time

177
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:50.420
It affected missiles with the range of lower than 5500 km.

178
00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:58.140
The agreement limited only missiles located on the ground. It never affected missiles located in the sea or the aircraft.

179
00:22:02.100 --> 00:22:07.100
That agreement was created in the interests of the USA, and they are wrong by changing the rules now because they have no idea about the consequences.

180
00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:20.380
We said a lot of bad things about the USA, and I like and support it.

181
00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:25.380
But I always repeat that the darkest hour is near the dawn.

182
00:22:26.020 --> 00:22:31.020
It's really great that we have no illusions now. The worst thing is we had to wait for such time when all actions are more than obvious!

183
00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:40.580
We had to predict all these many years before, if we wanted to keep or sovereignty, and protect our interests

184
00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.900
I'm happy that we managed to understand it at least now. There was a moment when we totally lost the connection with the reality! Totally!

185
00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:02.500
Including the rulers of the country. So I want to repeat that the darkest hour is near the dawn.

186
00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:08.260
1. We understood it; 2. We can explain it to other people; 3. The government can't ignore the opinion of the society

187
00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:22.060
But they've just bought more securities in the USA! First they announced that they decreased it from 100 to 97 billion USD, and then bought new ones!

188
00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:29.820
I think that this is the result of the selection of the very same people from the past, who worked in the financial sector before!

189
00:23:32.540 --> 00:23:37.540
They main idea is to invest money, and get a small interest rate back. So they use it as a key strategy, which is wrong!

190
00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:50.300
But they are wrong! And I know that constant dropping wears away a stone, and our internal freedom will change the case.

191
00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:01.220
We need to feel easier about the WTO. We know that we joined it because there's a group of people that wants to sell raw materials to other countries.

192
00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:11.060
It's more about metals, and not about raw material!

193
00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:16.260
This new reality opens our eyes, and we can finally see the truth. We need to be free, flexible and innovative!

194
00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:30.020
We need to move forward, always creating something!

195
00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:35.020
I want to talk about the impossible situation with Europe. It's simply shocking!

196
00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:40.540
At the time when Europe was dealing with the USSR in the frames of the Warsaw Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, they were able to protect their interests!

197
00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:53.780
They needed gas, and they entered in the agreement with the scary USSR.

198
00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:02.220
Now, when there's no real threat, they became totally helpless and impotent!

199
00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:09.140
This is philosophy! Just look how people and their values can affect the political system of the countries!

200
00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:21.180
They have no idea how to protect their interests, even though they can protect themselves without the USA!

201
00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:28.100
They were dependent before, and they needed the "umbrella" from the USA. Now there's no threat!

202
00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:34.820
They are simply impotent. They were more powerful at the times of the USSR, even though there was a lot of problems too.

203
00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:42.660
Because small and useless people became politics! No, wait!

204
00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:47.260
That confirms the idea that the human resources is the key

205
00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:52.260
You said about small people. But there's a reason to become smaller! They have a different set of values

206
00:25:55.900 --> 00:26:00.900
they have no motivation these days

207
00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.460
They don't have independence or sovereignty too! Because the EU is big and uneven!

208
00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:14.460
We need to keep this in mind because many Russian people are saying that we need to find a different way of crawling in front of the USA!

209
00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:25.700
We need to use it, and then we will have a great dialog with them, and so on!

210
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:31.500
Look at Europe! They can't protect their own interests! Not to mention Russia... Actually they are not our friends, and they never were friends.

211
00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:40.900
Europe depends on the USA, but this dependence is not as fatal as they think!

212
00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:46.700
This dependence is hidden in the head of politics!

213
00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:51.700
When you are weak and dependent, and these qualities live in your head,

214
00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:00.460
you will lose! And we need to learn this lesson too!

215
00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:05.460
Sergey brought us to another interesting topic... We still have some free time, and we will continue after a short break

216
00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:13.860
Walker said that they supply FGM-148 Javelin to show Russia that it will lose a lot of soldiers and citizens in case if the decides to act too intense.

217
00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:31.340
Igor was right when he told about the Mediterranean fleet. Russia explained that it will stay there for a long time

218
00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:40.420
In order to fight terrorism! Yes, but this is not the unique opportunity!

219
00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:45.420
If the USA wants to talk with us using the language of "number of dead soldiers", our answer can be a really asymmetric one!

220
00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:59.180
Currently, we are kind and smiling. We don't supply weapons to Taliban in Afghanistan these days.

221
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:11.380
And in many other areas... we never cooperate with powers, which are fighting against the USA

222
00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:23.020
And I can't say that the USA does the same... This path is really dangerous one...

223
00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:28.540
I don't even want to think about the bloody consequences of such a conflict...

224
00:28:33.300 --> 00:28:35.300
A short break...

225
00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:49.100
I really adore Trump! He wrote that in case if the agreement with North Korea takes place, they won't use Libyan strategy, and Kim Jong-un will be "extremely happy!"

226
00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.820
He wrote that in Twitter: "Extremely happy"

227
00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:04.820
European Commission offered a brilliant idea to increase the amount of American gas in order to remove fees against steel and aluminum from Russia.

228
00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:19.140
Trump is a great guy! He talked with Stoltenberg, and told that they are great guys because they managed to collect a lot of money!

229
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:29.980
He looked around, and saw only weak people, so he decided to shake all countries around.

230
00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:37.300
We need to think about our country too! They say that we are not allowed to do anything.

231
00:29:40.980 --> 00:29:44.140
Otherwise, we won't have access to technologies...

232
00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:49.140
I don't remember any new technologies received by Russia since 1990's.

233
00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:55.140
They took a lot! They even destroyed an entire field in the 90's.

234
00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:02.020
Which technologies? They always offer a box of apples, and they never offer us a set of shovels and trees to create a fruit garden here.

235
00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:13.260
This is a trick! They will never give us any technology!

236
00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:19.100
We need to be patient. And I want to tell you about another brilliant decision. Russian money are so safe in the USA...

237
00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:26.900
Look at the money of Iran! They are so safe, that people of Iran can be 10000% sure that this money will never return to their country.

238
00:30:33.380 --> 00:30:38.380
We need to regain consciousness! They made a law against us!

239
00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:44.460
It says: Iran, North Korea and Russia

240
00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:48.180
We need to forget about illusions! That's it!

241
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:53.180
We need to talk about the interests of the economy, and not about some abstract interests!

242
00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:00.340
We discussed it yesterday! We need to wake up right away!

243
00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:06.980
Talking about technologies... All our attempts to buy big industrial companies even during the "warm" period in our relations, failed one by one.

244
00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:17.940
It was prohibited! I remember that Sberbank wanted to buy Opel!

245
00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.420
Yes, Opel, Britanica and so on

246
00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:25.260
Does it mean that we can't get any technologies from the West? No, it doesn't.

247
00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:29.940
We need to use a different approach, working from the side and from the bottom, and not from the top.

248
00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:34.940
Are you talking about the industrial intelligence (Department T), which was popular during the Soviet times?

249
00:31:40.180 --> 00:31:42.180
Do you mean that too??!!

250
00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:47.180
Such intelligence is not always illegal. The main thing is to track the aspiring teams and scientists.

251
00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:56.620
We need to catch them at the early stage, and not when they have a Noble Prize of several billions of capital.

252
00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:05.900
We offer them grants only when we see their Nobel Prize! He won't give us anything because it's too late.

253
00:32:10.460 --> 00:32:15.460
And if we find a young scientists and offer him favorable conditions...
Like they do with the weapons!

254
00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:23.220
Half of them was made by young people, who was noticed when they were students.

255
00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:28.940
I want to say that such a legal industrial intelligence, which includes detailed tracking of the open projects...

256
00:32:33.940 --> 00:32:38.940
The main source of new technologies is the hard work with aspiring scientists and intelligent people!

257
00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:48.580
And this is a tradition. Even Peter the Great invited the best scientists from Europe to work here.

258
00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:58.820
Such behavior allowed keeping the balance of our country in 18th and 19th centuries.

259
00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:07.020
By the way, the reputation of Russia as a country that creates an additional pole of power with its own technical foundation

260
00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:22.900
will only improve our positions in the eyes of new resources.

261
00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.220
From the East and from the West too!

262
00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:32.220
I want to say that the USA is walking on the edge... Trump is able to achieve desired results... yet...

263
00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:40.180
But it's dangerous because secondary sanctions can't be used to often, and it such a big scale!

264
00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:45.980
They made a couple of public action against Swiss Bank, German Bank and French Bank for not observing the US sanctions (!) against Iran and Sudan.

265
00:33:55.980 --> 00:34:00.980
All the banks paid a lot of money... BNP Pariba paid around 9 billion USD because they want to have access to the US market.

266
00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:08.700
All other banks saw that they have to respect the US sanctions, even if they work in different jurisdiction.

267
00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:17.020
All European companies had no protection from the EU, dealing with the USA on their own.

268
00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:24.820
You don't want to say one obvious thing. This stage is brand new. Trump managed to apply his local laws to the entire Europe!

269
00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:40.660
There's no independent system of the law. Europe is defeated! Period.

270
00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:48.060
The USA becomes a global empire because their laws can be applied anywhere else...

271
00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:53.820
Trade wars take place for many years in a row. European and American suppliers of metals had a lot of mutual conflicts in the past.

272
00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:04.020
Europe can solve such local conflicts. But they have no idea what to do with the new Imperial approach of the USA, which punishes any company in the world for violations of their local (US) laws.

273
00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:20.380
In order to make an answer, Europe needs an independent financial, technological and other systems,

274
00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:29.700
including consulting, audit and rating agencies too

275
00:35:29.700 --> 00:35:34.620
They need to restore the infrastructure for economical sovereignty.

276
00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:39.620
That's what we have to do in BRICS, attracting other European countries, which will see our success and progress.

277
00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:52.500
Many people are talking about the technological breakthrough. I can make an example of such technological breakthrough...

278
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:03.500
I came from Saint Petersburg this morning. Obukhovsky Factory was build 155 years ago.

279
00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:09.500
This factory received its own coat of arms and the flag from the emperor. This factory is a technological park!

280
00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:18.740
It's the 21st century. 6 industrial companies are united within the JSC Concern VKO "Almaz-Antey"

281
00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:28.580
Boeing is just a toy in comparison with it! There are many things, which can be shown to Russia and to the entire world!

282
00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:37.060
And these are not just missiles, like S400, S500 and other components produced by VKO.

283
00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:45.540
They create new technologies in the field of space, air defense, military defense.

284
00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:56.260
They use each ruble invested in the military field of Russian Federation!

285
00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:03.820
We need to use such technological parks, which are available all around Russia!

286
00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:13.380
I want to remind you that the first decree of Putin was to create JSC Concern VKO "Almaz-Antey" as a vertically integrated holding.

287
00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:21.420
This is a real gem in the crown of Russian defense industry!

288
00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:26.420
The USA wants to block JSC Concern VKO "Almaz-Antey" because Calibers,

289
00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:33.260
S500, and air traffic control system, which provide the national security in the air field, are made by JSC Concern VKO "Almaz-Antey".

290
00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:47.660
Our defense industry is the driver of the economical growth of the country, and we shouldn't be shy of that!

291
00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:58.300
Liberals are shouting that we are killing our healthcare, education and science by supporting the defense industry...

292
00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:08.100
Look at Trump! He's a lobbyist of the US defense industry and the technological sector!

293
00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:22.420
We need to forget about all the fixations (sounds as complexes in Russian)!

294
00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.620
Don't throw S500 complex (word games) away!

295
00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:33.300
We have to keep the missile complexes!

296
00:38:33.300 --> 00:38:38.300
Vladimir, we don't need to add a lot of military things into the life. We don't need to hate the USA on the genetic level.

297
00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:47.300
Remember that when in Rome do as the Romans do!

298
00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:54.380
We need to show pragmatism and cynicism towards NATO, the US, and Europe.

299
00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:01.820
I want to offer you a different version of your proverb: when in Rome do as the Russians do!

300
00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:08.700
Nikolay Zlobin

301
00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:13.700
I want to agree with your words about Trump. He manages to use all the opportunities available in his country.

302
00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:24.420
He's not hiding his actions under good faith. He has an opportunity, so the country has to use it!

303
00:39:32.940 --> 00:39:37.940
So he tries to use all the opportunities, getting more profits, and expanding the presence of the USA. In fact, the foreign policy is the process of expanding the presence.

304
00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:49.660
The more presence you have, the more successful you are!

305
00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:54.660
Americans support him because of his actions in both foreign and national policy. He brings money, creates new working places

306
00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:07.380
he even managed to decrease taxes for the first time in history!

307
00:40:07.380 --> 00:40:12.380
Maybe he will fail in something, but still... he explores all the opportunities of his country.

308
00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:19.980
Talking about Russia. You need to evaluate what you have, and how you can use it. There has to be no fear.

309
00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:27.340
It doesn't have to be only military strategy. Look at Trump! All his achievements are strictly economical!

310
00:40:31.740 --> 00:40:33.740
But he has support of the Army!

311
00:40:33.740 --> 00:40:38.740
He has it, but he uses only economical tools. Can Russia use such tools without involving the army? I have no answer, and you need to hear the experts.

312
00:40:46.140 --> 00:40:48.140
Yes, but only with several countries.

313
00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:53.140
Call it sanctions if you want, and use. Tell me, why there's no Russian mobile carriers in the Eastern Ukraine (Donbass)?

314
00:40:55.500 --> 00:41:00.500
Why there's no Sberbank (Russian National Bank) in Crimea?

315
00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:06.940
Because US sanctions are respected and followed. You blame them here, and you follow them in the nearest building!

316
00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:11.940
I agree that Russia needs a strategy. But does it have to be made on the foundation of the contradictions with the USA?

317
00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:29.860
How long can Russia hold it, keeping the real balance between two economies in mind?

318
00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:33.260
Host: as long as you want!

319
00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:35.260
Why do we need to oppose each other?

320
00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:40.260
You need a different model. I've heard how you said that you will do something, and the USA will be affected.

321
00:41:40.420 --> 00:41:45.380
Russia won't benefit from it.
We can do that, but using non-economical methods!

322
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:47.380
I understand.

323
00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:52.380
The conflict between the USA and Russia is bad for both parties, but the USA can hold it much longer.

324
00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:58.940
The USA has such partners as GB, Germany and France. They can support them, or make an attack if required. Furthermore, there are new partners coming soon: India for example!

325
00:42:05.700 --> 00:42:10.700
Islamic countries, and even China! You have to agree that the USA and China has a lot of agreements and trading activities.

326
00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:17.580
You can't say that India, China and Arabic countries are allies of the USA.

327
00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:23.980
I would say that they are pro-Russian allies...

328
00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:28.980
They are balancing, trying to find an optimal solution in the field of defense...

329
00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:36.980
I agree that the defense industry is one of the most important things. But Saudi Arabia has the second biggest military budget in the world!

330
00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:42.740
Do you take this into account? Of course not!

331
00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.740
What are you talking about? Which units?

332
00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:46.740
About expenses

333
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:49.100
They spend 10-11% of the budget.

334
00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:54.100
As I know it looks as follows: 1. USA, 2. China and 3. Saudi Arabia.

335
00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:00.220
But they have no success in Yemen!

336
00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:05.220
That's what I'm trying to say! Such countries as Vietnam, which spend a lot of money for the defense industry, have no real presence in the world.

337
00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:12.940
While economically developed countries, such as the USA have a real presence. Trump is using economical tools to expand the presence of the USA!

338
00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:22.220
What is the presence of Germany and France?
It's great for Europe?
What exactly?

339
00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:26.300
But the USA can order them whatever they want!
Yes, they are weak with the USA.

340
00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:29.860
But they are not weak with Ukraine. They can do whatever they want with it!

341
00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:32.420
Ukraine can be controlled even by the North Korea...

342
00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:34.420
And Russia too, don't be shy...

343
00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:39.060
Russia is a threat for Germany now...

344
00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:42.860
You need to understand the end of this opposition. What will you do then?

345
00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:44.860
We don't have any other option!

346
00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:49.860
Do we have to be defeated?
You are happy because your neighbor is suffering, and it's not a strategy!

347
00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:56.020
We face a lot of aggressive actions, so we have to protect our own interests!

348
00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:59.820
You are right! Your interests!

349
00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:04.820
The idea is simple. Do you think that the USA can invade Ukraine and do everything to affect our national interests?

350
00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:17.220
Be ready to get other types of responses, which are not economical ones.

351
00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:23.460
You were right saying about the difference in economies, but who wants to answer in the financial field?

352
00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:28.620
That's what I said! Russia needs to understand its strategy!

353
00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:33.620
There are many other options, and you can't say that the USA is so big that we have to fall on the ground and surrender. We did it in the 90's.

354
00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:40.660
They stole everything, destroyed us, and gave no help at all!

355
00:44:41.460 --> 00:44:46.460
I really think that Russia is pro-US country, and all emotions are shown only on TV and in conversations.

356
00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:56.140
What do you mean by saying pro-US or anti-US? We don't have any problems between our nations.

357
00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:02.300
We respect your people and culture

358
00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:07.300
Is the USA a pro-Russian country?

359
00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:10.860
You can't even ask this in the USA!

360
00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:15.860
Then why do you create laws aimed not only at Russia, but at each and every citizen of Russia?

361
00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:22.420
There are several points of conflict between Russia and the USA.

362
00:45:22.420 --> 00:45:24.420
For example Iran

363
00:45:24.420 --> 00:45:26.420
Iran makes no sense now

364
00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:29.500
What is your interest in Ukraine?

365
00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:34.500
What are looking for? Is Ukraine a neighbor of the USA?

366
00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:40.060
Why do you say about neighbors?
The first sanctions were imposed because of Ukraine!

367
00:45:41.780 --> 00:45:46.780
So the USA is interested in presence on the territory of all the neighbors of Russia!

368
00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:58.140
I want to say something. Sergey said that all forecasts of this show came true. That's not true! Ukraine hasn't collapsed!

369
00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.500
How? What's going on there?

370
00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:06.420
Can I finish my idea! Damn!

371
00:46:06.420 --> 00:46:08.420
Is it still a country?

372
00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:13.420
After the creation of Novorossiya (Eastern Ukraine) and inclusion of Crimea, I've heard a lot of things during this TV show.

373
00:46:13.740 --> 00:46:18.740
I was told that Ukraine would be divided into several parts...
Wait a bit...

374
00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:25.340
Just wait a bit!
Let me finish!
Just wait!
I won't say anything...

375
00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:29.980
We need to listen to other people.
Why would you ask me a question?
I didn't ask you anything.

376
00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:33.020
You had a discussion with your ego!

377
00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:38.020
While Nikolay was talking, I wanted to discuss economical problems, but I have another idea now.

378
00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:46.820
The problem of Russia is that we are still trying to observe the rules in the relations with the USA.

379
00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:54.300
The USA is a very vulnerable country! Incredibly vulnerable. I was there many times, and I saw it myself.

380
00:46:59.300 --> 00:47:04.300
I was walking in New York along the Fifth Avenue. There's a lot of shops owned by Latin Americans.

381
00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:10.980
I know some Spanish, so I told them that I worked in Cuba. They told me about Fidel, and I understood that a huge number of Americans hate the USA.

382
00:47:22.980 --> 00:47:27.980
Once I spent a night with a police patrol. I had to write an article about their work.

383
00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:35.500
I saw black people and their approach to the USA. We could use this opportunity to explode and fire the USA!

384
00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:47.260
They tried to solve the issue by choosing Obama and the previous Secretary of State too...

385
00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:58.180
We follow the rules, and we know that some things are prohibited.

386
00:47:58.300 --> 00:48:00.300
We just don't know how to do that!

387
00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:05.300
The USA did everything to burn the USSR. Armenians and Georgians had no problems with Nagorno-Karabakh. And at that time the USA started to send a lot of information and articles.

388
00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:18.220
There's only one way to defeat Russia. You need to make different nations killing each other.

389
00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:25.820
We had Chechen Republic before... If we used the same methods in the USA, we could decrease its size and the number of potential problems too.

390
00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:34.900
We shall never do that! Because we will be punished by the God!

391
00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:42.460
I'm sure that one day this problem will explode the USA!

392
00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:49.380
Americans like to criticize their country and their government. It's not hatred!

393
00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:54.540
I remember Mexicans working in California...

394
00:48:55.620 --> 00:49:00.340
Did you forget mayhem in the USA? Or the methods, which were used to suppress it?

395
00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:05.220
If we used the same level of violence to suppress people in Russia...

396
00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:07.220
Just remember!

397
00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:12.220
This is a really serious problem, and the USA have to do something with it!

398
00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:18.340
I'm back to the 70's... I won't even comment this.

399
00:49:18.340 --> 00:49:20.340
Was there the case of Rodney King?

400
00:49:20.340 --> 00:49:22.340
It was!

401
00:49:22.340 --> 00:49:24.340
How many people were killed?

402
00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:29.340
Don't say that the USA lives in a miracle world!

403
00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:36.620
There's no miracle!
There is, and it's called advertising...

404
00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:51.780
My colleagues confirmed my idea that the USA is in the center of the world.

405
00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:57.260
We have an order, but the USA is still here. We understand the power of the enemy, and we have to defend ourselves.

406
00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:08.460
We have to defend not because we want to fight, and not because we hate the USA. For example, I have good feeling about the USA; otherwise, I wouldn't spend so much time with it.

407
00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:19.460
We all love the USA

408
00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:24.460
In other hand, we can't ignore their actions... and it breaks the balance.

409
00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:35.060
We are talking about the preparation of the army, buying their securities

410
00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:45.020
We pay no attention to the Consulate captured by you (USA).

411
00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:50.700
We pay no attention to the behavior of the USA on the territory of our neighbors. The USA has returned to the strategy, which was used in the 90's.

412
00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:07.860
I'm talking about Kazakhstan, Middle Asia, Armenia and so on.

413
00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:15.100
They had such strategy before, and now they returned it.

414
00:51:19.940 --> 00:51:24.940
We have to answer, but how? I can't agree that Trump is a protectionist...

415
00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:31.420
The USA can't be a protectionist because more than 40% of its industrial companies are located behind the national borders.

416
00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:38.780
The deficiency of goods appears as a result of the exchange between the companies.

417
00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:46.620
He wants to create new balance in this situation.

418
00:51:46.620 --> 00:51:51.620
Another thing is that he implements work, which was done since 1945

419
00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:57.180
We are always talking about this. Europe does the same. Why can't Europe trade with Iran in Euro?

420
00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:04.420
Can they buy Iranian oil for Euro and not for dollars?

421
00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:09.420
Such interconnections make it hard to change the balance that was created in the late 40's

422
00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:21.500
So Trump is just using things, which were founded many years ago... Is there any way to fight with pax?

423
00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:30.180
No doubt that it's hard to find allies, and each of them has its own national interests.

424
00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:40.660
China tries to make something against the USA, but always steps back when they get even the slightest answer from the USA.

425
00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:50.380
I think that Europe is done. They couldn't enter into the constitutional agreement in 2004, and added 10 pro-USA countries

426
00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:04.780
So the actions of Macron are right and correct. Europe is afraid not only of Russia.

427
00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:13.980
The USA tries to press Russia and Central Asia in order to avoid consolidation of Eurasia at any cost

428
00:53:19.540 --> 00:53:24.540
Their goal was the same at all times - to avoid consolidation of countries in Eurasia.

429
00:53:31.900 --> 00:53:36.900
We need to do the opposite. We have to do everything to create consolidation.

430
00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:43.580
Consolidation can be made by increasing the internal potential of the country.

431
00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:50.140
How evil was the reaction of EU and American media after the opening of the Crimean Bridge?

432
00:53:54.380 --> 00:53:59.380
Such events are more painful that the creation of new weapons and equipment, which can't be used right now.

433
00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:10.580
And in case with the bridge, nobody believed in it. It supposed to be broken, stolen, forgotten and so on. But Russia did it.

434
00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:24.220
If Russia manages to make a breakthrough announced by Vladimir Putin, we can become a center of attraction.

435
00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:34.860
It's really hard to make it because we need to create an attractive model of development.

436
00:54:37.820 --> 00:54:42.820
Is our current model attractive for the neighbors?

437
00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:47.820
It is not... And we have to create a new one!

438
00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:53.660
We are not fighting with the USA. We are trying to protect our sovereign rights to make our own decisions.

439
00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:08.940
Talking about the model... Some aspects of your speech were right, but we are trying to follow the way given by the USA.

440
00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:20.100
Our model is attractive, You can see it in the number of labor migrants, in the volume of trades, and in the level of security, The countries from Central Asia know the red line, which can't be crossed.

441
00:55:35.620 --> 00:55:40.620
You said about the policy, which was used in Central Asia before. The USA had to cancel it as a result of our actions, and internal changes of the local countries, which realized what would happen.

442
00:55:51.100 --> 00:55:56.100
Now about the model. It's not perfect, but we have it.

443
00:56:01.860 --> 00:56:06.860
And this integration of countries in Eurasia is not an occasion. It's not a result of will of Royal Emperors and Soviet leaders.

444
00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:16.820
It has a lot of real reasons. And as in case with all other big processes, it shows the dualism.

445
00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:26.300
Russia wants to consolidate countries, while the West and the USA want to do everything to avoid it.

446
00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:36.620
I want to say, Nikolay, that the West has no attractive model to offer to the former USSR countries

447
00:56:38.620 --> 00:56:43.620
We can't offer a model. What was the model offered to Ukraine by the West?

448
00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:48.980
Now Ukraine is near a catastrophe!

449
00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:54.700
Talking about Central Asia... We have some things and projects in common, but Europe and USA can't offer any super model of interaction with them.

450
00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:04.900
They are trying to find points of contact. You allows us going here, and we won't notice this and that.

451
00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:13.580
There's no model. And I want to say that even the leaders of the former USSR countries understand all the benefits of cooperation with Russia. Another problem is that we don't want to use these opportunities!

452
00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:26.060
We can give them a lot, but we don't know how to use it.

453
00:57:26.100 --> 00:57:31.100
We can't normally use everything we have to offer, even though it has some specific problems.

454
00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:37.940
Even Georgia and Ukraine are still keeping dozens of CIS agreements? Why? Because they enjoy benefits and advantages of such agreements!

455
00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:46.020
We don't need to follow the US logic. Oh, you don't have a model. We will always have significant flaws in this logic.

456
00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:54.940
This is the key problem of all former USSR countries. We are sure that we aren't good enough. And they always want some preferences from us.

457
00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:06.660
You have to give us a lot, and we don't have to because you don't have an attractive model

458
00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:12.660
Even though it has some truth, mainly it contains from the lack of self-confidence created with our own hands.

459
00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:19.460
A few words about the internal factors.

460
00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:25.700
We have a few people, who prefer globalism. For example, Nikolay, who always says about the big global world.

461
00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:36.580
And the majority of people prefers to develop the sovereignty. While the minority tries to push the idea of a big united world.

462
00:58:43.100 --> 00:58:48.100
Why? Because they want to earn a lot of money! While in fact we need to protect our sovereignty

463
00:58:51.740 --> 00:58:56.740
Otherwise, we won't be able to do anything, while politics will continue getting their interest rate because it's easier

464
00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:07.300
And the last moment, which always creates disputes between me and Nikolay Zlobin. I don't know if you can't see, or you pretend not to see this

465
00:59:11.620 --> 00:59:16.620
You are trying to say that any evil action is possible if it brings you some money

466
00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:25.700
And this is the national idea of the USA. And all other countries need to do the same to be as successful as the USA.

467
00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:33.580
We can't be like the USA because this is a dead-end and the way that leads nowhere.

468
00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:46.780
Our main priority is to create a model, which will be unique and different, allowing us to reach the goals.

469
00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:59.580
I can agree with many things, but not with the fact that our policy pushed the USA to change behavior in the former USSR countries.

470
01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:09.300
We had Medvedev at that time, and Obama decided that he could control all the territory of the former USSR right from Moscow.

471
01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:32.460
They thought it was a liberal government, which could be used for various manipulations.

472
01:00:32.940 --> 01:00:37.940
Talking about the cooperation between Russia and former USSR countries. I think this model comes from our socialistic past...

473
01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:55.340
We have to pay everyone... I like the approach of Trump. He says that you have to pay with money or votes if you want to get support and protection from the USA.

474
01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:14.100
Do we have to do the same?

475
01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:19.420
Now we are making the same things as the USSR did with its Western partners.

476
01:01:19.420 --> 01:01:24.420
We don't have too much time, so let's use short opinions. Obama realized that he had made a mistake with Medvedev when Russia started the peaceful operation.

477
01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.620
Putin didn't make a mistake!
Yes, he didn't in 2008

478
01:01:32.620 --> 01:01:37.620
Medvedev was the president in 2008.
Don't search the irony in my words, I'm absolutely serious, and you are smiling.

479
01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:43.980
Nobody is smiling except you.

480
01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:47.500
Maybe you know something what we don't know.

481
01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:52.500
And the second important moment. Bashar Assad is in Sochi today, they met with Vladimir Putin.

482
01:01:57.700 --> 01:02:02.700
And it seems that we are ready to offer an attractive model, which can't be found in the USA.

483
01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:12.100
We have the experience in Iraq and Afghanistan

484
01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.500
The USA was there for many years in a row

485
01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:20.460
And what is the final result? Chaos! What do we have now?

486
01:02:20.460 --> 01:02:25.460
The last elections in Iraq resulted in the victory of the power, which hates the USA.

487
01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:32.020
They support Iran, and we talked about it yesterday.

488
01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:35.060
Nikolay Zlobin, and then you.

489
01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:37.060
Be short!

490
01:02:37.060 --> 01:02:39.060
I will try!

491
01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:41.060
Try to speak in short words!

492
01:02:41.060 --> 01:02:46.060
I wrote a book more than 15 years ago, and I told about a new empire, which would offer a new attractive model to all other countries.

493
01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:51.780
So you are Carl Marx!

494
01:02:51.780 --> 01:02:56.780
It wasn't about the foreign policy, but about an efficient internal model!

495
01:02:58.900 --> 01:03:03.900
10, 12 or 15 years ago I wrote that we were living in the world of political losers, because all the models were pale

496
01:03:07.820 --> 01:03:12.820
The problem is that during the last 25 years the world became too American. Almost all the countries followed the American model to build their new world.

497
01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:25.540
They have similar Parliaments, Laws and Constitutions.

498
01:03:27.100 --> 01:03:32.100
Tell me, is there any country that wants to copy the current model of Russia?

499
01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:39.820
That's what I'm talking about! Who can take the Russian model to solve internal problems of the country?

500
01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:43.780
This is my understanding of the model!

501
01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:48.620
Who took their model? There's a democratic model, which can be used in many ways.

502
01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:53.420
I was asked not to talk too much, so I won't make a discussion.

503
01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:58.420
The USSR was an attractive model for a huge number of countries!

504
01:03:59.300 --> 01:04:03.260
They were taking the model of USSR in order to create their new countries!

505
01:04:03.260 --> 01:04:05.260
It was implemented involuntarily...

506
01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:07.260
Not at all!

507
01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:09.260
Who had chosen it?

508
01:04:09.260 --> 01:04:14.260
Where can one find a good model today?

509
01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:16.660
Did Eastern Europe select the model?

510
01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:19.820
Does Russia offer any other model now? Of course not!

511
01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:24.820
What was the model offered to Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya?

512
01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:29.820
Can I finish my speech?

513
01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:34.820
The thing is how the foreign policy affects the life of your own citizens!

514
01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:39.660
Your own citizens!

515
01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:44.660
Trump managed to improve the level of life, bringing more money that it was before his presidential term.

516
01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:53.500
Higher salaries, lower taxes... Why wouldn't they support it?

517
01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:57.180
Why can't we see it in Russia? Why is it so bad?

518
01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:01.220
That's why they support Putin here.

519
01:05:01.220 --> 01:05:03.220
Why is it considered bad?

520
01:05:03.220 --> 01:05:07.620
Since 2000 Russian people can see and feel a lot of changes!

521
01:05:07.620 --> 01:05:10.700
It's bad to kill people to take their money, Nikolay!

522
01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:13.540
This is bad, I agree!

523
01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:17.700
Cheating other people to take their money is bad too!

524
01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:19.700
I agree

525
01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:23.380
All these things are bad!

526
01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:28.380
If Americans don't understand such simple things... Are you people at all?

527
01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.300
Get patient! I'm patient!

528
01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:35.500
What a surprise! I've never seen so many emotions from you!

529
01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:40.500
It's evil! It's evil to say that one can kill a person just to take their money!

530
01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:45.220
Record me! Where's the camera! It's not normal!

531
01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:50.220
Bad words about the USA and its citizens (pretty unclear).

532
01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.100
Don't lie about my words!

533
01:05:53.100 --> 01:05:57.940
Nikolay, if you do like this once more, you can be filmed in the role of Lenin!

534
01:05:57.940 --> 01:06:01.460
You've just made movements like Vladimir Lenin had done many years before!

535
01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:06.460
I was trying to find your hat in the hand!

536
01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:08.820
Stop scaring us!

537
01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:13.820
I don't say it's normal. My idea is that the national policy has to bring benefits to your own citizens!

538
01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:20.980
Not to Syrian, not to any other people!

539
01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:25.620
You are talking about the same things, but Sergey says that you can't kill a million of Iraqi people for that!

540
01:06:25.620 --> 01:06:27.620
You can't!

541
01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:29.620
And you pretend not to see it!

542
01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:34.620
Or when you say that some bastards destroyed WTC, and you decide to start a war in Afghanistan.

543
01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:41.660
Now the US court says that Iran is guilty

544
01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:44.260
And pilots are from Saudi Arabia

545
01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.260
I want to say that people must have moral, and you don't believe in it!

546
01:06:46.260 --> 01:06:50.140
Why are you speaking on my behalf? Because you said it several times!

547
01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:55.140
You said many times that there's no place for moral in the international relations!

548
01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:58.180
Am I right?

549
01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:02.220
Yes, it's right for the foreign policy!

550
01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:07.220
We need to re-think our policy in the former USSR countries. The role of the ambassador in such countries has to be as prestigious as the similar role in Washington.

551
01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:17.700
We need to send real professionals, like Antonov!

552
01:07:20.540 --> 01:07:25.540
We need to increase the salaries for all diplomatic workers!

553
01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:30.580
I remember that I visited Yerevan in 2015 with Dmitry Kiselev

554
01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:35.660
We delivered speech for local experts in the field of political science. And I was shocked with one thing in Yerevan...

555
01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:40.580
There was a giant embassy of the USA.

556
01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:45.580
You just need to see it, to understand my feelings!

557
01:07:45.900 --> 01:07:50.900
We need new embassies! We need to send hundreds and thousands of them!

558
01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:58.740
We need to update the model of cooperation of Rossotrudnichestvo (Russian Cooperation).

559
01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:04.060
The current model is obsolete, and it can't be applied today!

560
01:08:04.780 --> 01:08:09.540
We need to use these tools. New diplomats, new ambassadors...

561
01:08:09.540 --> 01:08:14.540
People have to fight for the right to be an ambassador in a former USSR country!

562
01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:22.420
We need to change priorities. We will face a lot of problems if we lose the former USSR countries.

563
01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:28.620
They also need to learn local languages...

564
01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:30.620
Please

565
01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:35.100
I would like to tell a lot, but we don't have time...

566
01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:40.100
We need to see the difference between the model in the USA, and the model offered by the USA.

567
01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:47.500
The USA prefers to keep all the industrial companies outside of the USA. You need to pay a lot of money to local workers.

568
01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:53.340
So they move all the plants to the South America

569
01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:58.780
But they say: If you want to have investments, there has to be no problems and conflicts!

570
01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:05.140
That's why they choose dictators, who control the country, avoiding any protests

571
01:09:05.140 --> 01:09:10.140
They are democrats, but they want other countries to be dictatorships.

572
01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:17.420
You need to be harsh and strict, otherwise you won't get money

573
01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:23.100
We need to see the difference between the model in the USA, and the model offered by the USA.

574
01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:33.820
As they say, he's a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch!

575
01:09:33.820 --> 01:09:38.820
That's what we have to understand and remember!

576
01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:43.900
I want to notice that Trump changed this approach

577
01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:50.060
Trump understands that his people in "rusty belt" demand him to return the industrial companies to the USA

578
01:09:53.540 --> 01:09:58.540
He is ready to have some expenses.. And have you noticed that they are doing things, which were not recommended to do for us in order to support the international distribution of the labor force.

579
01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:12.820
The level of unemployment has dropped down. It was lower than in Russia... but

580
01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:17.820
Trump ordered things, which were not recommended to do for us in order to support the international distribution of the labor force.

581
01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:23.100
We need to avoid listening their advice. We have to look around at countries and their achievements...

582
01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:30.340
And we have to use all of them with clear mind!

583
01:10:30.340 --> 01:10:35.340
Who knows if the USA has its money in different countries?

584
01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:41.820
Do they buy securities in different countries? Yes, No?

585
01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:48.100
You all have been to the USA, but I want to say that it's pretty hard to exchange Euro there.

586
01:10:50.660 --> 01:10:52.660
Only USD

587
01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:54.660
Maybe at the airport...

588
01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:59.660
The American model was attractive in the previous century.

589
01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:07.300
At that time it was something really important and valuable.

590
01:11:09.700 --> 01:11:14.700
Marshall's plan played a huge role in the restoration of Europe.

591
01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:18.700
The goal was to create industrial companies, and not just send some money for free.

592
01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:23.700
The USA played a key role in the economic miracle in Japan and South Korea.

593
01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:28.980
and even China

594
01:11:30.300 --> 01:11:32.300
South Korea used benefits of China and North Korea

595
01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:35.820
Japan - China and USSR

596
01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:39.580
China was supported because it had the USSR

597
01:11:39.580 --> 01:11:44.580
When the opposition was over, the USA lost their role as a developer

598
01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:50.100
Their rules became really unpleasant for the entire world

599
01:11:51.660 --> 01:11:54.660
Which rules? Take a look at local regimes under the US control,

600
01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:06.260
Even if you are Mubaraq, it doesn't mean that you can't be overthrown during a revolution.

601
01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:11.380
It's like a black box. You don't know what's inside. It doesn't belong to you, and it can be controlled remotely.

602
01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:21.660
and it has a lot of additional hidden features. And this model is used by the US IT companies all over the world.

603
01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:29.700
Is this model attractive for sovereign countries?

604
01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:35.260
I don't think so. Is this model a great choice for a dependent regimes? I don't think so.

605
01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:40.260
It means that the model of the global empire of the USA is vulnerable!

606
01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:46.020
We have a conflict with the USA. We can't become more powerful than the empire!

607
01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:51.380
We can win only if we know how to use these vulnerabilities

608
01:12:53.020 --> 01:12:58.020
And we need to offer a new model for partners, who don't want to depend on the USA

609
01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:05.860
We need to avoid using such black boxes, offering them cooperation and mutual development.

610
01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:11.620
We need to wake up!

611
01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:16.620
And we need to restore the industrial power of the country using our own solutions!

612
01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:21.300
We won't be able to get profits from the sovereignty without it.

613
01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:26.300
I understand that you have to say a lot of things at night, but our time is over!

614
01:13:27.700 --> 01:13:32.300
Thank you! See you on Sunday!
