      <description>Vladimir Soloviev and his guests are discussing the current situation in the Middle East, including the problem of the nuclear deal with Iran, expansion of the USA, and other important problems of the region. They are trying to predict what’s going to happen, and whether the USA will attack Iran, potentially causing a new catastrophe in the region.
